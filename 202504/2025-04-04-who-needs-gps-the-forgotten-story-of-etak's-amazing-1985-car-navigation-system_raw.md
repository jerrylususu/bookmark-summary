Thirty years ago, a company called Etak released the first commercially available computerized navigation system for automobiles. Spearheaded by an engineer named Stan Honey and bankrolled by Nolan Bushnell, the cofounder of Atari, the company’s Navigator was so far ahead of its time that the phrase “ahead of its time” seems like an understatement.

Etak’s Navigator made the cover of the June 1985 issue of _Popular Science_.

To appreciate just how amazing the concept of car navigation was in 1985, you need to recall that the Global Positioning System–the constellation of satellites operated by the U.S. government–didn’t come fully online until a decade later, in 1995. Even then, the feds crippled GPS to be no more accurate than within 100 meters to ensure it wouldn’t help bad guys aim guided missiles. In 2000, that restriction was lifted, allowing a new era of consumer GPS navigational gadgets to flourish.

Etak beat modern GPS systems to market by a decade and a half. It was so early that its inventors had to digitize their own maps and figure out how to get them into an automobile in an era before solid-state mass storage, optical discs, or wireless Internet was available to do the job. (The solution: special tape cassettes.)

Everything about Etak’s Navigator had to be conceived from scratch. And it worked.

The Navigator wasn’t a big seller, especially by 2015 standards. But neither was it a dead end. To build it, Etak had to devise technologies and collect data that are still in use today by some of the most familiar navigation apps and devices on the planet. This is the little-known story of how it came to be.

#### It Started on a Yacht

The idea that became Etak began on the high seas. Bushnell had hired Honey to navigate his racing yacht _Charley_ through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.

One morning, around 4 a.m., the two men happened to be on night watch together. As the rest of the crew slept, they worked to get a fix on their location using a satellite orbiting the earth. It passed overhead once every 12 hours; through measuring Doppler shifts in radio waves, specialized equipment could determine a vessel’s latitude and longitude. However, its passage was only frequent enough to give the navigator a starting point to work from.
