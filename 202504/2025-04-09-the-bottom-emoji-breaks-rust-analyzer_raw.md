üëã This page was last updated ~2 years ago. Just so you know.

Some bugs are merely fun. Others are simply delicious!

Today‚Äôs pick is the latter.

[Reproducing the issue, part 1 -----------------------------](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer#reproducing-the-issue-part-1)(It may be tempting to skip that section, but reproducing an issue is an important part of figuring it out, so.)

I‚Äôve never used Emacs before, so let‚Äôs install it. I do most of my computing on an era-appropriate Ubuntu, today it‚Äôs Ubuntu 22.10, so I just need to:

```
$ sudo apt install emacs-nox
```

And then create a new Rust crate, `cd` into it, and launch emacs:

```
$ cargo new bottom
     Created binary (application) `bottom` package
$ cd bottom/
$ emacs
```

I am greeted with a terminal interface that says: ‚ÄúWelcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system‚Äù. I feel [religious](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/gospel.html) already.

To open `src/main.rs`, I can press `C-x C-f`, where `C-` means `Ctrl+` (and `M-` means `Alt+`, at least for me), which opens a ‚ÄúFind file‚Äù prompt at the bottom, pre-filled with the current working directory: for me that‚Äôs `~/bearcove/bottom`.

There‚Äôs tab-completion in there, so `s<TAB>m<TAB>` completes it to `.../src/main.rs`, and pressing Enter (which I understand Emacs folks spell `RET`, for Return) opens the file.

Without additional configuration, not much happens: there‚Äôs no syntax highlighting, no code intelligence of any kind, we have to ask for that.

So let‚Äôs ask for that.

With guidance from a friend (on IRC, of all places! what year is this?), I ended up putting the following in my `~/.emacs` file:

(The bit at the bottom was there originally, I‚Äôm guessing Ubuntu ships it? It didn‚Äôt have `lsp-ui` / `rustic` / `lsp-mode` before I restarted emacs).

Restarting emacs installs everything, just like Vim plug-in managers would do, so far, so good.

Opening `src/main.rs` again prompts me to import a workspace root, I pick the first option, which seems reasonable, and tada, we have Rust highlighting and inline documentation and stuff!

![Image 2: Windows Terminal screenshot showing emacs open on a Rust hello world source file](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer/assets/emacs~abb86632f43d5091.jxl)

Or rather, I do, because I have a `rust-analyzer` binary in path from a while ago (I contribute occasionally):

```
$ which rust-analyzer
/home/amos/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer

$ rust-analyzer --version
rust-analyzer 0.0.0 (caf23f291 2022-07-11)
```

This is old. [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is released every week. Let‚Äôs remove it and see if things still work.

```
$ rm $(which rust-analyzer)

$ emacs src/main.rs

(cut)
Server rls:83343/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer
for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n)
```

Ah. It doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs unfortunate!

[How rust-analyzer is distributed --------------------------------](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer#how-rust-analyzer-is-distributed)Rust components are normally distributed with `rustup`. `rustc` is a Rust component, so, it is:

```
$ which rustc
/home/amos/.cargo/bin/rustc

$ rustc -V
rustc 1.67.1 (d5a82bbd2 2023-02-07)

$ rustup show active-toolchain
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)

$ rustup which rustc
/home/amos/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rustc

$ ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rustc -V
rustc 1.67.1 (d5a82bbd2 2023-02-07)
```

You can also get it from elsewhere, and I‚Äôm sure you have your reasons, but they‚Äôre not relevant to the topic at hand.

After rust-analyzer was promoted from ‚Äúvery useful peripheral project‚Äù to [official rust-lang project](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/21/rust-analyzer-joins-rust-org.html), it started being distributed as a rustup component.

Back then, it was done by it being a git submodule in the [rust-lang/rust](http://github.com/rust-lang/rust) repository. Since then, it‚Äôs been [migrated to a git subtree](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99603), which helped resolve the [rust-analyzer support for proc macros in Rust nightly](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/proc-macro-support-in-rust-analyzer-for-nightly-rustc-versions) issue.

Why do we care? Because that means there‚Äôs technically two trees for rust-analyzer at any given moment in time: a git subtree can (and should) be merged in _either direction_: ra-\>rust because ra moves fast and is developed mostly in its own repository, and rust-\>ra because the proc-macro bridge might change.

So! We can install `rust-analyzer` with rustup:

```
$ rustup component add rust-analyzer
info: downloading component 'rust-analyzer'
info: installing component 'rust-analyzer'
```

But that doesn‚Äôt set up a ‚Äúproxy binary‚Äù under `~/.cargo/bin`:

```
$ which rust-analyzer

(it prints nothing)
```

It is, however, somewhere on disk:

```
$ rustup which rust-analyzer
/home/amos/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rust-analyzer
```

We can even try it out ourselves by launching it, and typing `{}` then Enter/Return:

```
$ ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rust-analyzer
{}
[ERROR rust_analyzer] Unexpected error: expected initialize request, got error: receiving on an empty and disconnected channel
expected initialize request, got error: receiving on an empty and disconnected channel

```

That‚Äôs right! It‚Äôs our old friend JSON-over-stdin.

Since this is a reasonable way in which users might want to install rust-analyzer, let‚Äôs see if our emacs setup picks it up:

```
$ emacs src/main.rs
(cut)
Server rls:86574/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer for details).
Do you want to restart it? (y or n)
```

No. This is unfortunate, again.

And even if it _did_ work, it would still not be ideal, because‚Ä¶ that version is old too:

```
$ $(rustup which rust-analyzer) --version
rust-analyzer 1.67.1 (d5a82bb 2023-02-07)
```

Okay.. that one‚Äôs only a few days old, but only because Rust 1.67.0 did an [oopsie-woopsie when it comes to thin archives](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/02/09/Rust-1.67.1.html#whats-in-1671-stable) and they had to release 1.67.1 shortly after.

But yeah, if we check the version shipped with Rust 1.67.0:

```
$ $(rustup +1.67.0 which rust-analyzer) --version
rust-analyzer 1.67.0 (fc594f1 2023-01-24)
```

It‚Äôs from around that time. And that hash refers to a a commit in [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits/fc594f1), not `rust-lang/rust-analyzer`, so depending when the the last sync has been made, it might be even further behind.

rust-analyzer wants to ship every monday, and so, it does! At the time of this writing, the latest release is from 2023-02-13, and it‚Äôs [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/releases/tag/2023-02-13), which is where the VSCode extension _used_ to download it from.

These days, it ships the rust-analyzer binary directly in the extension:

```

But other editor plug-ins, like [coc-rust-analyzer](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-rust-analyzer), download it [right from GitHub releases](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-rust-analyzer/blob/4a7ea2d7c3ba866d257b958175f4149823bc3a8f/src/downloader.ts).

It seemed odd that the Emacs ecosystem would lack such functionality, so I looked it up: `rustic` says about automatic server installation that [lsp-mode provides this feature, but eglot doesn‚Äôt](https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic#automatic-server-installation), and then it says ‚ÄúInstall rust-analyzer manually‚Äù.

In lsp-mode, I found code that [seems like it should download rust-analyzer](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/781889628b9e0504fde279371548149deae4849d/clients/lsp-rust.el#L894-L905), but I‚Äôm not sure how to use it.

The docs talk about an `lsp-enable-suggest-server-download` option, which [defaults to true](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/settings/mode/#lsp-enable-suggest-server-download), but I‚Äôve never seen it download the server (I know because I checked `~/.emacs.d/.cache/lsp`).

Although‚Ä¶ now that I look at it closer, this error message:

```
Server rls:83343/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer
for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n)
```

Mentions `rls`, which is the predecessor to `rust-analyzer`, and that definitely sounds wrong. But `lsp-rust-server` defaults to `rust-analyzer`, so.. is it just falling back? Setting the option explicitly doesn‚Äôt seem to change much.

After more Emacs learning, I discovered how to switch to the `*lsp-log*` buffer [the docs point to](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/troubleshooting/) and discovered the following:

```
Command "rls" is present on the path.
Command "rust-analyzer" is not present on the path.
Command "rls" is present on the path.
Command "rust-analyzer" is not present on the path.
Found the following clients for /home/amos/bearcove/bottom/src/main.rs: (server-id rls, priority -1)
The following clients were selected based on priority: (server-id rls, priority -1)
```

This is a _horrible_ fallback. RLS [is deprecated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls#%EF%B8%8F-rls-is-no-longer-supported). The only reason it‚Äôs falling back to it is because there _is_ a proxy binary for it, that exists, but errors out since the component is not installed:

```
$ which rls
/home/amos/.cargo/bin/rls

$ rls
error: 'rls' is not installed for the toolchain 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
To install, run `rustup component add rls`

$ echo $?
1
```

Let‚Äôs summarize the situation:

*   rustup is the ‚Äúblessed‚Äù way to get a rust toolchain (you can do nice things like [pinning](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) with it)
*   it sets up an `rls` proxy binary under `~/.cargo/bin` like it should, because even though rls is deprecated, some folks still use it for now I guess
*   `lsp-mode` looks for `rust-analyzer` first, `rls` second, and if it finds the second (even if it‚Äôs just a stub/proxy that says ‚Äúsorry not installed‚Äù), it falls back to it and the ‚Äúauto download rust-analyzer‚Äù logic never triggers

I must admit this is an even bigger deal than what I was originally planning to write about! If this is the experience Emacs folks have been having with Rust, this explains a lot of things.

My sample size is N=3, but everyone in that sample ended up building rust-analyzer from source, and that means they get an extremely up-to-date RA once, and then most probably forget to update it forever, which is even worse than grabbing it from rustup.

Please remind me to submit a PR to `lsp-mode` that yanks ALL the rls stuff after I‚Äôm done writing this article. Someone must.

ANYWAY.

For today, let‚Äôs just tell `lsp-mode` to use the one from rustup:

```
_;; under (use-package lsp-mode
__;; in the :custom block
_  (lsp-rust-analyzer-server-command (list (string-trim (shell-command-to-string _"rustup which rust-analyzer"_))))
```

Just kidding! That doesn‚Äôt work. And yes, that evaluates to the right path. And yes, that ‚Äúcustom‚Äù option expects a list. And yes, I did learn what `custom-set-variables` does while troubleshooting this, and no, setting it through there doesn‚Äôt work either.

The `*Messages*` buffer still shows that it couldn‚Äôt find `rust-analyzer` in PATH.

My best guess is that `rustic`, which can use either `lsp-mode` or `eglot`, overrides this very late in the game, and I can‚Äôt do a damn thing about it. I‚Äôm not sure why they even have an ‚ÄúAutomatic server installation‚Äù section in their docs then.

So. Fine. We‚Äôll use violence and create a shell script in `~/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer`, containing this:

```
#!/bin/bash

$(rustup which rust-analyzer) "$@"
```

```
$ chmod +x ~/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer
$ hash -r
$ rust-analyzer --version
rust-analyzer 1.67.1 (d5a82bb 2023-02-07)

```

Tada, we did a crime!

[Reproducing the issue, part 2 -----------------------------](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer#reproducing-the-issue-part-2)So, now that we have emacs configured with lsp-mode and rustic, using a recent-ish rust-analyzer, we‚Äôre back to square one.

Note that I forgot to add [company-mode](https://company-mode.github.io/), the thing that actually provides completions: we can add it next to `(use-package rustic)` in `~/.emacs`:

```
_;; in `~/.emacs`
_
_;; cut: everything before that line
_
(require _'_use-package-ensure)
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)

(use-package rustic)
_;; üëá new!
_(use-package company-mode)
```

Restarting emacs installs it, and we now get completions ‚Äúafter typing a few characters and waiting a bit‚Äù. You can bind a key combination to ‚Äúcompany-complete‚Äù to have it pop up on-demand, which I did, and then Emacs told me ‚Äúno, you shouldn‚Äôt write it `C-SPC`, you should write it `[?\C- ]`‚Äù, which is exceedingly rude, but let‚Äôs move on.

(The keybinding didn‚Äôt work in the terminal but it did work in emacs-gtk, which I installed out of frustration).

Anyway!

Now onto the actual bug: let‚Äôs add to our code.. an emoji! Any emoji.

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
  _// ü•∫_
  _println__!__(__"Hello, world!"__)__;_
_}_
```

Upon typing this emoji in the editor, a message will pop up in the bottom bar (appropriate) saying the LSP server crashed, would you like to restart it, no I wouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd like to see the messages, a little `C-x b *rust-anal<TAB>::std<TAB>` later I‚Äôm in buffer `*rust-analyzer::stderr*` seeing this:

```

```

_That_ is the bug we‚Äôre interested in.

And if you have some instinct as to the source of this bug, let me tell you: it‚Äôs so much worse than you think.

[Exploring UTF-8 and UTF-16 with Rust ------------------------------------](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer#exploring-utf-8-and-utf-16-with-rust)Rust strings are UTF-8, period.

And by ‚ÄúRust strings‚Äù I mean the owned type [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/string/struct.String.html) and string slices, aka [&str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html).

There‚Äôs a ton of other types that dereference to `str`, like `Box<str>`, `Arc<str>` etc., but they‚Äôre not relevant to this discussion.

We can tell by printing the underlying byte representation:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _println__!__(__"{:02x?}"__,_ _"abc"__.__as_bytes__(__)__)__;_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run --quiet
[61, 62, 63]
```

Which is not to say that you cannot use UTF-16 string representation in Rust, you just.. make your own type for it. Or, more likely, you use a crate, like [widestring](https://lib.rs/crates/widestring):

```
$ cargo add widestring
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding widestring v1.0.2 to dependencies.
             Features:
             + alloc
             + std
```

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _// this is a macro, it does the right thing_
    _let_ s = widestring_::_u16str!_(__"abc"__)__;_
    _println__!__(__"{:04x?}"__,_ s_.__as_slice__(__)__)__;_
_}_
```

This gives us a `&[u16]`, so it‚Äôs not quite what we‚Äôre looking for:

```
$ cargo run --quiet
[0061, 0062, 0063]
```

Getting at the bytes is harder, but not impossible:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _// this is a macro, it does the right thing_
    _let_ s = widestring_::_u16str!_(__"abc"__)__;_
    _{_
        _let_ u16s = s_.__as_slice__(__)__;_
        _let_ _(___,_ u8s_,_ __)_ = _unsafe_ _{_ u16s_.__align_to__::__<__u8__>__(__)_ _}__;_
        _println__!__(__"{:02x?}"__,_ u8s_)__;_
    _}_
_}_
```

Heck, it shouldn‚Äôt even _really_ require unsafe, since anything that‚Äôs u16-aligned is also definitely u8-aligned, here, let me make a safe wrapper for it:

```
_fn_ _u16_slice_to_u8_slice__(__s__:_ _&__[__u16__]__)_ -> _&__[__u8__]_ _{_
    _unsafe_ _{_
        _// Safety: u8 slices don't require any alignment, it really doesn't_
        _// get any smaller without bit-twiddling_
        s_.__align_to__::__<__u8__>__(__)__.__1_
    _}_
_}_
```

There:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _// this is a macro, it does the right thing_
    _let_ s = widestring_::_u16str!_(__"abc"__)__;_
    _{_
        _let_ u16s = s_.__as_slice__(__)__;_
        _let_ u8s = _u16_slice_to_u8_slice__(_u16s_)__;_
        _println__!__(__"{:02x?}"__,_ u8s_)__;_
    _}_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run --quiet
[61, 00, 62, 00, 63, 00]
```

Okay, cool! So utf-16 is just utf-8 with extra zeroes.

![Image 3: Cool bear](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/img/reimena/cool-bear-neutral~206d206a2216de47.jxl)

No, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ no.

No, of course not. It‚Äôs easy with ASCII characters, but it gets more complicated the fancier you want to get.

How about ‚Äú√©‚Äù for example. That sounds fancy! How does it look?

```
_const_ S_:_ _&__str_ = _"√©"__;_

_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _println__!__(__"{S:?}"__)__;_
    _println__!__(__"UTF-8   {:02x?}"__,_ S_.__as_bytes__(__)__)__;_
    _println__!__(_
        _"UTF-16  {:02x?}"__,_
        _u16_slice_to_u8_slice__(__(_widestring_::_u16str!_(_S_)__)__.__as_slice__(__)__)_
    _)__;_
_}_

_fn_ _u16_slice_to_u8_slice__(__s__:_ _&__[__u16__]__)_ -> _&__[__u8__]_ _{_
    _unsafe_ _{_
        _// Safety: u8 slices don't require any alignment, it really doesn't_
        _// get any smaller without bit-twiddling_
        s_.__align_to__::__<__u8__>__(__)__.__1_
    _}_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run -q
"√©"
UTF-8   [c3, a9]
UTF-16  [e9, 00]
```

Ah, not fancy enough! It takes up 2 bytes in UTF-8, and one ‚Äúcode unit‚Äù in UTF-16, which we‚Äôre showing as two bytes, because we can.

Let‚Äôs try something fancier!

```
$ cargo run -q
"≈ì"
UTF-8   [c5, 93]
UTF-16  [53, 01]
```

‚ÄúLatin Small Ligature Oe‚Äù is in the [Latin Extended-A](https://unicode-table.com/en/0153/) range: that goes `0100-017F`. We no longer have a ‚Äúuseless byte‚Äù in the UTF-16 encoding, since the code unit is actually ‚Äú0153‚Äù (in hexadecimal).

Meanwhile, in UTF-8 land, we still need two bytes to encode it. All is well.

Let‚Äôs get fancier still! How about some Hiragana? (`3040-309F`)

```
$ cargo run -q
"„ÅÅ"
UTF-8   [e3, 81, 81]
UTF-16  [41, 30]
```

‚ÄúHiragana Letter Small A‚Äù takes 3 bytes in UTF-8, but only 2 bytes (one 16-bit code unit) in UTF-16. Huh! That must be why people loved UTF-16 so much, they made it the default string representation [for Java](https://devdocs.io/openjdk~8/java/lang/string) _and_ [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_codepoints_and_grapheme_clusters) (no relation).

Because at some point in the history of the human race, we thought 65536 characters were _more than enough_. It would be _absurd_ to need more characters than that. And so we made UCS-2, which used two bytes for every character, enabling the encoding of the BMP, the [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set#Encoding_forms).

But that‚Äôs a lie. We knew 65536 characters weren‚Äôt enough, because China.

(Among other reasons).

So there were already 1.1 million characters defined by Unicode, and some of those wouldn‚Äôt fit, and so we made UCS-4, which used four bytes for every character, but that sounds _terribly wasteful_ compared to plain old ASCII-with-a-codepage-good-luck-exporting-documents I guess.

So ISO/IEC 2022 specifies escape sequences to _switch between character sets_. I wish I was making it up, but [I‚Äôm not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_2022#Character_set_designations)! Apparently xterm supports some of it! I know!!! I can‚Äôt believe it either!

So anyway, UTF-16 is an evolution of UCS-2 that says hey maybe switching character encodings in-band isn‚Äôt the greatest thing (also I‚Äôm not sure how widely adopted those escape sequences were in the first place), let‚Äôs just have a thing where _most_ characters fit in 2 bytes, and those that don‚Äôt fit in.. more.

So let‚Äôs look at our Hiragana again but simply print UTF-16 code units now, instead of the underlying two bytes:

```
_const_ S_:_ _&__str_ = _"„ÅÅ"__;_

_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _println__!__(__"{S:?}"__)__;_
    _println__!__(__"UTF-8   {:02x?}"__,_ S_.__as_bytes__(__)__)__;_
    _println__!__(__"UTF-16  {:02x?}"__,_ _(_widestring_::_u16str!_(_S_)__)__.__as_slice__(__)__)__;_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run -q
"„ÅÅ"
UTF-8   [e3, 81, 81]
UTF-16  [3041]
```

Okay, cool, so: for U+3041, we need 3 bytes in UTF-8, and one UTF-16 code unit (2 bytes).

Let us now embark on a cross-plane journey:

```
$ cargo run -q
"†ÄÄ"
UTF-8   [f0, a0, 80, 80]
UTF-16  [d840, dc00]
```

But first, a minute of silence for anyone reading this from a Linux desktop machine.

‚Ä¶

There. In case you can‚Äôt see it, the character in question is [Ideograph the sound made by breathing in; oh! (cf. U+311B BOPOMOFO LETTER O, which is derived from this character) CJK](https://unicode-table.com/en/20000/), or ‚Äúhƒì‚Äù, for friends.

It is U+20000, which is outside the BMP.

![Image 4: Cool bear](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/img/reimena/cool-bear-neutral~206d206a2216de47.jxl)

The?

BMP, [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane), we‚Äôve gone over this: it‚Äôs `0000-FFFF`, except‚Ä¶ except part of it is reserved for UTF-16 surrogates! High surrogates are `D800-DB7F`, and surprise surprise, that‚Äôs what our first code unit is: `d840`. Low surrogates are `DC00-DFFF`, and that‚Äôs what our second code unit is.

How does this work? Well, we take our codepoint, in our case `U+20000`, and subtract 0x10000 from it. We get `0x10000`, or, in binary:

```
 0b00010000000000000000
   <--------><-------->
       hi        lo
```

Then we take the high ten bits, add them to `0xD800`, in our case, `0b1000000` gives `0x40`, so we get `0xD840`. As for the low ten bits, we add them to `0xDC00`, for us that‚Äôs 0x0 (should‚Äôve picked a different example), so we get `0xDC00`.

Easy peasy.

And so, ‚Äú†ÄÄ‚Äù (which should render as ![Image 5: he](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer/assets/he~a4395e65b08b813b.jxl)) is:

*   1 [grapheme cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters#Characters%2C_grapheme_clusters_and_glyphs)
*   1 unicode character (with the unicode code point U+20000)
*   4 UTF-8 bytes
*   2 UTF-16 code units

All clear? Good.

How about our emoji? Our innocent little emoji? Look at it. It didn‚Äôt mean to cause any trouble. Let‚Äôs find out:

```
$ cargo run -q
"ü•∫"
UTF-8   [f0, 9f, a5, ba]
UTF-16  [d83e, dd7a]
```

Okay, same! Ooh I bet we can find what codepoint it is by doing the inverse transformation on the UTF-16 surrogate pair here:

```
$ gdb --quiet
(cut)
(gdb) p/x 0xd83e - 0xd800
$1 = 0x3e
(gdb) p/x 0xdd7a - 0xdc00
$2 = 0x17a
```

Shh I‚Äôm trying to focus here.

```
(continued)

(gdb) p/t 0x3e
$3 = 111110
(gdb) p/t 0x17a
$4 = 101111010
```

![Image 8: Cool bear](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/img/reimena/cool-bear-neutral~206d206a2216de47.jxl)

Wait wait why are you going through binary, you can just do a left shift here, right?

![Image 9: Amos](https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/img/reimena/amos-neutral~7ef5a72ffb0f390c.jxl)

Yes, yes, alright

```
(continued)

(gdb) p/x (0x3e << 10) + 0x17a + 0x10000
$5 = 0x1f97a
```

Hurray, here it is! [U+1F97A Bottom Face Emoji](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F97A/).

So. Rust really likes UTF-8, and so do I. Hence, I really like Rust.

Whereas some languages just do not let you mutate strings at all (it‚Äôs safer that way), Rust does! You can totally do this, for example:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _let_ _mut_ s = _String__::__from__(__"amos"__)__;_
    s_.__replace_range__(__0_.._1__,_ _"c"__)__;_
    _dbg__!__(_s_)__;_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run -q
[src/main.rs:4] s = "cmos"
```

Note that this is safe rust!

Also note that Amos is my first name, and [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) is a type of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions.

Coincidence? Probably.

We can also do this, using unsafe Rust:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _let_ _mut_ s = _String__::__from__(__"amos"__)__;_
    _// why b'c'? because 'c' is a char, whereas b'c' is a u8 (a byte)._
    _unsafe_ _{_ s_.__as_bytes_mut__(__)__[__0__]_ = _b'c'_ _}__;_
    _dbg__!__(_s_)__;_
_}_
```

And we get the same output.

Which begs the question, why is the former safe and the latter unsafe, if they do the same darn thing!

It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt.

The unsafe version lets us do this:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _let_ _mut_ s = _String__::__from__(__"ü•∫"__)__;_
    _unsafe_ _{_
        s_.__as_bytes_mut__(__)__[__3__]_ = _b'#'__;_
    _}__;_
    _dbg__!__(_s_)__;_
_}_
```

```
$ cargo run --quiet
[src/main.rs:6] s = "ÔøΩ#"
```

Which is, say it with me: undefined behaviorrrr ooooh spooky ghost emoji! We broke an invariant (strings must always be valid UTF-8) and now anything goes, we could even have memory corruption come out of this! Probably!

Them‚Äôs the rules of unsafe Rust: if we use it, we are suddenly responsible for maintaining all the invariants ourselves. Just like we are, all the time, in unsafe languages like C/C++ (also C, and C++).

`replace_range` does not let us do that:

```
_fn_ _main__(__)_ _{_
    _let_ _mut_ s = _String__::__from__(__"ü•∫"__)__;_
    s_.__replace_range__(__3_.._4__,_ _"#"__)__;_
    _dbg__!__(_s_)__;_
_}_
```

```

So this is what‚Äôs happening with lsp-mode + rust-analyzer, right?

lsp-mode is sending bad offsets, rust-analyzer panics. Mystery solved?

Well, yes. But why does that happen? And what should rust-analyzer actually do in this case?

[The Language Server Protocol ----------------------------](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-bottom-emoji-breaks-rust-analyzer#the-language-server-protocol)To answer these questions, we must look at the LSP: the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

And instead of reading the spec directly, let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs _actually_ being sent between an LSP client (like lsp-mode for Emacs) and an LSP server (like rust-analyzer).

There‚Äôs something built into lsp-mode to do this, the `lsp-log-io` setting, but I think it‚Äôs a lot more fun to capture it ourselves, by providing a wrapper for rust-analyzer.
