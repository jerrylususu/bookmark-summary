“The Door Problem”
==================

Posted on [April 21, 2014](https://lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/ "“The Door Problem”")

“So what does a game designer do? Are you an artist? Do you design characters and write the story? Or no, wait, you’re a programmer?”

Game design is one of those nebulous terms to people outside the game industry that’s about as clear as the “astrophysicist” job title is to me. It’s also my job, so I find myself explaining what game design means to a lot of people from different backgrounds, some of whom don’t know anything about games.

The Door Problem
----------------

I like to describe my job in terms of “The Door Problem”.

Premise: You are making a game.

*   Are there doors in your game?
*   Can the player open them?
*   Can the player open every door in the game?
*   Or are some doors for decoration?
*   How does the player know the difference?
*   Are doors you can open green and ones you can’t red? Is there trash piled up in front of doors you can’t use? Did you just remove the doorknobs and call it a day?
*   Can doors be locked and unlocked?
*   What tells a player a door is locked and will open, as opposed to a door that they will never open?
*   Does a player know how to unlock a door? Do they need a key? To hack a console? To solve a puzzle? To wait until a story moment passes?
*   Are there doors that can open but the player can never enter them?
*   Where do enemies come from? Do they run in from doors? Do those doors lock afterwards?
*   How does the player open a door? Do they just walk up to it and it slides open? Does it swing open? Does the player have to press a button to open it?
*   Do doors lock behind the player?
*   What happens if there are two players? Does it only lock after both players pass through the door?
*   What if the level is REALLY BIG and can’t all exist at the same time? If one player stays behind, the floor might disappear from under them. What do you do?
*   Do you stop one player from progressing any further until both are together in the same room?
*   Do you teleport the player that stayed behind?
*   What size is a door?
*   Does it have to be big enough for a player to get through?
*   What about co-op players? What if player 1 is standing in the doorway – does that block player 2?
*   What about allies following you? How many of them need to get through the door without getting stuck?
*   What about enemies? Do mini-bosses that are larger than a person also need to fit through the door?

It’s a pretty classic design problem. SOMEONE has to solve The Door Problem, and that someone is a designer.

The Other Door Problems
-----------------------

To help people understand the role breakdowns at a big company, I sometimes go into how other people deal with doors.

*   Creative Director: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”
*   **Project Manager**: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”
*   Designer: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”
*   Concept Artist: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”
*   Art Director: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”
*   Environment Artist: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”
*   Animator: “I made the door open and close.”
*   **Sound Designer**: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”
*   **Audio Engineer**: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”
*   **Composer**: “I created a theme song for the door.”
*   FX Artist: “I added some cool sparks to the door when it opens.”
*   **Writer**: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’ “
*   Lighter: “There is a bright red light over the door when it’s locked, and a green one when it’s opened.”
*   Legal: “The environment artist put a Starbucks logo on the door. You need to remove that if you don’t want to be sued.”
*   **Character Artist**: “I don’t really care about this door until it can start wearing hats.”
*   Gameplay Programmer: “This door asset now opens and closes based on proximity to the player. It can also be locked and unlocked through script.”
*   **AI Programmer:** “Enemies and allies now know if a door is there and whether they can go through it.”
*   **Network Programmer:** “Do all the players need to see the door open at the same time?”
*   **Release Engineer**: “You need to get your doors in by 3pm if you want them on the disk.”
*   **Core Engine Programmer:** “I have optimized the code to allow up to 1024 doors in the game.”
*   **Tools Programmer:** “I made it even easier for you to place doors.”
*   Level Designer: “I put the door in my level and locked it. After an event, I unlocked it.”
*   **UI Designer**: “There’s now an objective marker on the door, and it has its own icon on the map.”
*   **Combat Designer**: “Enemies will spawn behind doors, and lay cover fire as their allies enter the room. Unless the player is looking inside the door in which case they will spawn behind a different door.”
*   **Systems Designer**: “A level 4 player earns 148xp for opening this door at the cost of 3 gold.”
*   **Monetization Designer**: “We could charge the player $.99 to open the door now, or wait 24 hours for it to open automatically.”
*   QA Tester: “I walked to the door. I ran to the door. I jumped at the door. I stood in the doorway until it closed. I saved and reloaded and walked to the door. I died and reloaded then walked to the door. I threw grenades at the door.”
*   **UX / Usability Researcher**: “I found some people on Craigslist to go through the door so we could see what problems crop up.”
*    **Localization**: “Door. Puerta. Porta. Porte. Tür. Dør. Deur. Drzwi. Drws. 문”
*   **Producer**: “Do we need to give everyone those doors or can we save them for a pre-order bonus?”
*   **Publisher**: “Those doors are really going to help this game stand out during the fall line-up.”
*   **CEO:** “I want you all to know how much I appreciate the time and effort put into making those doors.”
*   **PR**: “To all our fans, you’re going to go crazy over our next reveal #gamedev #doors #nextgen #retweet”
*   **Community Manager**: “I let the fans know that their concerns about doors will be addressed in the upcoming patch.”
*   **Customer Support**: “A player contacted us, confused about doors. I gave them detailed instructions on how to use them.”
*   Player: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”

One of the reasons I like this example is because it’s so mundane. There’s an impression that game design is flashy and cool and about crazy ideas and fun all the time. But when I start off with, “Let me tell you about doors…” it cuts straight to the everyday practical considerations.

_Recent edits: Added localization, character artist, system designer, combat designer, composer, audio engineer, monetization designer, and I think that’ll be it for now._

    We have a strong and integrated customer support team. Can I suggest you add to the list:
    
    Community Management: Some players want more doors. Some players want fewer doors.  
    Customer Support: Players are confused about doors.

    When posting to FB added:  
    Localization – “Door” “Porte” “Tür” “Porta”  
    Business Intelligence – An average player opens a door 23 times an hour.  
    Security – Bots can easily exploit the doors.  
    Scale Engineer – If 1 million people close the door at the same time the game crashes.  
    Brand Manager – Here is a blur trailer of a guy with stubble opening the door as it explodes.  
    Web Designer – I made an online guide to all the doors in the game.  
    Sales – Ok, for BestBuy I need blue doors, Target, red doors.  
    Lore Master – That door knocker wasn’t added to the universe until 200 years after the setting of our game.

        Negotiation. Buy-in. Empowering people with the ability to make decisions regarding their work. Appointing one person as the arbiter or owner of a piece of the game (i.e. doors).
        
        There’s always trade-offs between technical considerations (can we actually do it? will it hurt the framerate/memory or impact other systems? how much programmer time will it take? are there workarounds?) and design considerations (how important is this to the player? how does it impact the play experience? is it the right decision for this game?) and the need to balance them.
        
        Knowing how to work in a team is a very important skill. Knowing when you can make a decision yourself or among your team vs. when you need someone higher up – like a Creative Director – to make the decision is also pretty important.

    Physics Programmer: “Do rag dolls collide with the door? Do they keep the door open?”
    
    This can be a tricky problem, depending on the design. Mainly because designers sometimes want behavior that is not physically plausible. Like, rag dolls must collide with the door but not block it. See the irresistible force paradox.

    Was sad to see my role, a possibly even less understood one, excluded from the list!
    
    Technical Artist #1: “I’ve created a modular rig for our door animations that can be re-targeted to every door in the game.”
    
    Technical Artist #2: “I’ve split the door texture’s luminance and color data so we can use one set of textures for every door in the game.”
    
    Technical Artist #3: “I’ve written a Maya tool that generates one thousand unique door meshes in 30 seconds.”
    
    Technical Artist #4: “I’ve written an uber shader for our doors which fades opacity as players approach it, turns it into a hologram, animates the UVs to show a rippling effect…”
    
    Technical Artist #5: “I’ve re-written the naming conventions to accommodate door assets. Doors are now found in Environments/Props/Doors and are named in the format of ‘\[environment prefix\]\_prop\_door\_\[size of door\]\_\[open or closed\]\_mesh.\[filetype\]'”

    It sounds like any programming, or even broader, engineering problem. A full understanding of the system being modeled for user interaction should be planned out (depending on the process you’re using. Agile, waterfall, etc). I’d like to think that as a better than average software engineer, and a gamer, I could manage these complex yet mundane details, all the while maintaining focus on whats really important, the users experience. A lot of those questions you asked about the door should be answered with one question, “Why does the user care about this door?”
    
    You really make game design sound boring and thankless though. Now if you excuse me, I’m going back to my job of getting strings in databases…

    This is great.
    
    One bit of feedback. If you have a company with both Narrative Designers and Writers, then the following:  
    Writer: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’”  
    Would be a better description for a Narrative Designer.
    
    The Writer would then be.  
    Writer: “Snarky Protagonist \[the Player\]: The door opened. Gee, that was unexpected.”
    
    The difference being that the Narrative Designer is in charge of calling out where there will be a line and what that line will express, and then the Narrative Designer will go into the engine and make that line trigger in the tools. Then the writer will go in and write the line in the character’s voice. :)

    Perhaps you could add:
    
    Media: In conclusion, the door opening wasn’t immersive, but this issue aside gamers who are fans of the door, potentially may have fun opening it. 7/10
    
    or

    Thank you. Now I know, why big teams are needed for modern games and why games are getting worse and worse with no innovation. As described here, a couple of Nerds seem to think about the smallest detail of obvious things, rather to think about how to make a game, which is fun.  
    Who cares about the size of a doorknob in a game with an innovative and fun idea?  
    Remember “Castles of Dr. Creep”? A game made by two people packed with lots of great ideas and elements which fit together. Every room in every dungeon a new challenge. A density of gameplay nowadays a whole year of games can’t provide.  
    It seems like I can stop wondering why, after reading this.

    Awesome description. I think I want to be a game designer, and I’m not kidding either. There are so many awfully designed doors in so many otherwise great games. I won’t mention any names, though, and instead just say that I really liked the doors in BioShock Infinite, Mass Effect and Remember Me.
    
    I think the funniest doors are those that when the player walks right up to them – and you know you’re only seeing like 1 percent of the door on-screen – the character can still manage somehow to open it. The funniest door can also be the most disappointing if you don’t actually see it open and it just goes directly to the transition load screen.

    this is awesome! I think you missed:
    
    Gameplay Camera: Does camera clip through door? Does camera need special door logic  
    FX: we need to add a sparkly glint to the doorknob because players keep missing it  
    Level Design: We need to set up streaming volumes on each side of the door so we load / unload the previous level. We need to add a fade to hide the load between doors  
    Mesher: I need the doors and doorframes modular and a fixed dimension so I can place them in my level correctly  
    Animator: I need the door handle height a uniform location, so I can line up player animation of player opening the door  
    Character Artist: You need to increase the door height so a our larger enemy can fit through it

    C’mon, what kind of weak QA do you have there. He didn’t even spend last two weeks repeatedly opening and closing all the doors in the game in a rapid fashion and various orders to figure out that perhaps-not-random crash(that will get a “Won’t Fix” resolution anyway), right after a week of shooting every door with every weapon to doublecheck new SFX (that is going to be redone anyway) on both Durango and ORBIS builds.

    You forgot the argument about whether the doors open inwards our out, and how the animator only did one set of animations (inwards) because the producer forgot to schedule the time for two door opening animations for each of three extra NPC body types that the designer added in March, and when QA found out that you could break level 4 because the door only opened in and when the full squad stood in the anteroom it blocked the door and stopped all progress (because the level designer didn’t get the message that the animator didn’t get the message that the producer forgot to schedule the extra animations) the QA manager flagged it as a show stopper just before we had to go to cert and so the project director made the level designer remove that door entirely, which meant you could see the final boss before the animations had loaded, which was immediately posted to reddit after the game shipped and people were laughing at the designer for being such a lame designer but at least the level wasn’t broken.

        We are not mentioned directly, but at least for what I do the Tool Programmers section does it for me: I literally made a tool to place doors easily once. I agree tech art being not only difficult to define but so broad it is hard to put it all what we might be doing in a list. I would say we stream line asset creation from DCC to engine.

    You forgot the speedrunner role that magically finds out that when you press A and B at the same time pointing towards the bottom right corner of this window while standing right at the very edge of the door holding the default knife with the golden skin, you will immediately launch to the boss room which saves 3 seconds of the run by skipping an unskippable dialogue of ‘Hey look!

    From the article title, I thought you’d mention whether doors trigger a zone transition, the inside vs outside rendering algorithms, and how sound changes when passing through doors. I remember reading an article about Portal (a game about doors which the player can place) where they talked about some of the complex engineering challenges of getting sound correctly through doors which dynamically make the level no longer a simple graph. I suppose those are all Core Engine Programmer issues though.

    See I found this post amusing as someone with a brother who is a video game designer. I however am an Astrophysicist. The key difference is he does explain what he does and people kinda seem to get it- he makes video games. I explain my current research or what I’m doing and almost no one understands what I’m doing to the point where I often say “thanks for asking and showing interest but I have no way to answer your question that you will understand and as a consequence won’t bore you” I like this door analogy because of some of the mundane things my brother has talked about being complicated to make work in a realistic manner sometimes.

    I was QA on Skyrim.  
    Doors were actually a big focus of testing for a bunch of reasons. The loading screen could interrupt things that might or might not be resilient to being interrupted, and might or might not need to be resilient to that.
    
    Whether they were locked or not was also the result of quest scripting, that might or might not be expecting a specific sequence of player actions, and breaking that expectation might lead to an unexpected state of the door.
    
    In some prerelease versions, this maneuver sometimes led to some pretty hilarious bugs.
    
    “I opened the door, but during the door open animation, I got on my horse before the loading into the next zone.”
    
    You never knew what would happen when that one worked. Sometimes it was a horse causing chaos in a building, sometimes it was an unintelligible broken screen.

    The QA Tester should rly end with something like: Everything seems to be fine.
