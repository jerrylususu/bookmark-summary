| **2. 释义** 在本条例中，除文意另有所指外— **「不当停顿」** (inappropriate halting) 指除急性身体不适外，因任何目的而在泳道内完全停顿，包括但不限于调整泳镜、进行存在主义思考，或与相邻泳道的熟人打招呼； **「泳道」** (lane) 指游泳设施内由水底黑线、水面浮标所界定，或在无前述标识时依习惯或指示所界定，供单向或双向通行的指定路径； **「拥挤时段」** (peak hours) 指视觉上超过百分之五十的水面被人体或其附属物（如浮板）覆盖的时段；或当游泳者试图完成一个标准转身时，有超过百分之五十的机率会与另一名游泳者或池壁发生非自愿的肢体接触的时段。如无相反证据，夏日的周末、公众假期及工作日下午四时后须视为拥挤时段； **「指定泳道」** (designated lane) 指经清晰标示以供特定速度及用途的泳道； **「夏日」** (summer) 指公历四月至十月期间； **「前进方式」** (propulsion method) 指游泳者用以产生前进动力的任何肢体动作； **「超宽前进方式」** (wide-load propulsion method) 指仰泳、蝶泳，或任何其横向动作幅度显著超出或容易显著超出游泳者肩宽的前进方式。 | **2. Interpretation** In this Ordinance, unless the context otherwise requires— **“designated lane”** (指定泳道) means a lane clearly marked for a specific speed and purpose; **“inappropriate halting”** (不当停顿) means, except in cases of acute physical discomfort, the complete cessation of movement in a lane for any purpose, including but not limited to adjusting goggles, engaging in existential contemplation, or greeting acquaintances in an adjacent lane; **“lane”** (泳道) means a designated path within a swimming facility, demarcated by a bottom black line or surface buoys, or, in the absence of the prior, by custom or instructions, for unidirectional or bidirectional traffic; **“peak hours”** (拥挤时段) means a period during which more than 50% of the water surface is visually occupied by persons or their appurtenances (such as kickboards); or a period during which a swimmer attempting a standard turn has a greater than 50% probability of making unintentional physical contact with another swimmer or the pool wall. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, weekends, public holidays, and after 4 p.m. on weekdays during summer is deemed to be peak hours; **“propulsion method”** (前进方式) means any limb movement used by a swimmer to generate forward momentum; **“summer”** (夏日) means the period from April to October in the Gregorian calendar; **“wide-load propulsion method”** (超宽前进方式) means backstroke, butterfly stroke, or any propulsion method whose lateral movements significantly or are likely to significantly exceed the swimmer’s shoulder width. |
| **3. 泳道选择及一般行为** (1) 任何人须选择一条与其预计速度最相符的指定泳道，而非其渴望达到的速度。 (2) 在拥挤时段，任何人应当避免进入在一般人看来已无充足空间的泳道，除非所有泳道在一般人看来均已无充足空间。 (3) 在双向泳道中，任何人须保持在水底黑线的右方行进，但为完成第 6 条允许的超越所需的场合除外。 (4) 任何人不得作出横越一条或多于一条泳道的行为，除非是为了进出泳池或转换泳道，且该行为不会对其他游泳者构成危险或不便。 | **3. Lane selection and general conduct** (1) A person must select a designated lane that is most consistent with their anticipated speed, not their desired speed. (2) During peak hours, a person must refrain from entering a lane that, in the opinion of a reasonable person, lacks sufficient space, unless all lanes appear to a reasonable person to lack sufficient space. (3) In a bidirectional lane, a person must keep to the right of the bottom black line, save for the occasion needed for the completion of an overtaking permitted under section 6. (4) A person must not execute a manoeuvre that crosses one or more lanes, except for the purpose of entering, exiting, or changing lanes, provided that such manoeuvre does not endanger or inconvenience other swimmers. |
| **4. 水上优先通行权** (1) 任何人不得以违反水上优先通行权的方式使用游泳设施。 (2) 就第 (1) 款而言，「水上优先通行权」指一项原则，据此，一名正在连续游弋的游泳者，其通行权优先于任何正进入泳道、突然转向或进行静态水下健体操的游泳者。 | **4.
