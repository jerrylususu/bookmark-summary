The materials also support two on-line courses: [Nand2Tetris Part](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) [](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)[I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer): Hardware (chapters/projects 1-6), and [Nand2Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2): Software (chapters/projects 7-12).

​

Nand to Tetris courses are taught at 400+ universities, high schools, and bootcamps. The students who take them range from high schoolers to Ph.D. students to senior engineers. Here is an [extended syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWCOVIcg0-dX0XtL3KwNyra6jzMogXLL/view?usp=sharing) of a typical academic-version course.
