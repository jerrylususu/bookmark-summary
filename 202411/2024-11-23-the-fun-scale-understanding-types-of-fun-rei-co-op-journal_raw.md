The Fun Scale
=============

[Kelly Cordes](https://www.rei.com/blog/bio/kelly-cordes)|October 24, 2014

         

Everybody likes fun. And fun, like anything, can be nuanced; not all fun is created equal.

But it wasn’t until June 2001, while bushwhacking through thickets of Alaskan devil’s club—home to hungry grizzly bears—that I learned of the Fun Scale. Fun, it turns out, is quantifiable.

The bushwhacking came about because my friend Peter had invited me to join him on a low-key outing: a boat ride across a gorgeous bay to climb a small, mellow mountain. It sounded like the perfect finish to my trip, as I’d spent the previous month climbing in the Alaska Range. My climbing partner, Scott, and I had had a terrific trip. Though we were often terrified while actually climbing, we loved it later.

I tried to keep up with Peter as branches whacked me in the face.

“You know that there are three types of fun,” Peter said, bushwacking onward.

“Hey, bear!” I responded. We were trying to return to his sailboat—home to a cooler of cold beers.

Peter kept going, and described the Fun Scale. Here it is:

### Type I Fun

Type 1 fun is enjoyable while it’s happening. Also known as, simply, fun. Good food, 5.8 hand cracks. Sport climbing, powder skiing, margaritas.

### Type II Fun

Type 2 fun is miserable while it’s happening, but fun in retrospect. It usually begins with the best intentions, and then things get carried away. Riding your bicycle across the country. Doing an ultramarathon. Working out till you puke, and, usually, ice and alpine climbing. Also surely familiar to mothers, at least during childbirth and the dreaded teenage years.

I remember that very trip to Alaska, just a week before learning about the Fun Scale, when Scott and I climbed Mt. Huntington. Huntington might be the most beautiful mountain in the Alaska Range, but the final thousand feet was horrifying—steep sugar snow that collapsed beneath our feet as we battled upward, unable to down-climb, and unable to find protection or anchors. On the summit, with the immaculate expanse of the range unfolding in every direction, Scott turned to me and said, in complete seriousness, “I want my mom so bad right now.”

By the time we reached Talkeetna his tune changed: “Ya know, that wasn’t so bad. What should we try next year?”

### Type III Fun

Type 3 fun is not fun at all. Not even in retrospect. Afterward, you think, “What in the hell was I doing? If I ever come up with another idea that stupid, somebody slap some sense into me.” Many alpine climbs. Failed relationships that lacked Type I fun. Offwidths. Writing a book.

Into which category a given experience falls, of course, is highly subjective and highly subject to shifts (particularly from III to II) born of the rosy reflections afforded us by the passage of time.

Which is probably a good thing. After all, as alpinists and mothers both know: It doesn’t have to be “fun” to be fun.

    Isn’t Type III Fun logically the kind of things which are so much fun in the moment and which you horribly regret later? E.g. binge eating ice cream or drinking whiskey all night.

    Type 3 fun is fun at the time, not fun in retrospect. (Binging anything, hooking up with an ex, etc.)  
    Type 4 fun is fun for everyone but you.

    No, no, no. This numbering system is all wrong. Type 1 is correct. Type 2 fun is enjoyable at the time but regrettable later, e.g., overindulging. Type 3 is what you call type 2: not fun during, good fun later. And type 4 fun is neither fun at the time, nor later. This numbering scheme forms a simple, four-cell matrix, with now/later on the vertical axis and fun/no fun on the horizontal axis.

        Nice idea. Should the matrix axis be Fun/no Fun both vertical and horizontal? With one axis being now and the other later? So Cell 1,1 = Fun Now and Fun Later. Cell 2,2 = No Fun now and No Fun later.

        Although I totally agree with your numbering system, a quick look around google makes it clear that this numbering system is a lot more accepted. Therefore I propose keeping it like it is and changing what you call type 2 fun to inverted type 2 fun

    HI Mr, Cordes. I found your article to be immensely eye-opening. However, I would like to suggest the existence of a fourth type of fun. Type 4: When it is fun in the moment, but not-so-fun afterward. For example, eating ice cream whilst being lactose intolerant is exhilarating in the moment, but only leads to regret. I have lived experience, and I resent the type four erasure. Please contact me with any questions, or if you would like to collaborate in the future. My colleagues would love to back from you as well. Thank you, enjoy your day.

    The outdoor industry loves this type of stuff: to quantify something that is pure then package and sell it or even better opt into it and make it a lifestyle and make it a hashtag to target the right people.

        Haven’t you ever heard a story from someone at a party about how they did something so incredibly dumb or something really unlucky happened to them that they just have to share the story? That’s type 3 fun, the “you’ll never believe what happened to me” type

    I often enjoy what I would categorize as fun 2.5. This is the type of fun like a hobby. Mine is woodworking. The fun begins with an idea that you have seen other woodworkers do, however, you have never done this project and it will require a good amount of research and a bit of ingenuity to carry it out with the tools you have.  
    It all starts out good with the best of intentions and enthusiasm. Shortly into the project you find it somewhat more challenging and need to do more thinking on all the variables to end up with the favored result. In the end it is realized as very fun and extremely satisfying with the finished project.  
    Success on such projects, often lead me to attempt ideas and projects I have never seen anyone do, nor am I able to find any information on such an item.

    As many others have before me, I’d like to suggest a revision to the fun scale. This is based on my experience with life in general.
    
    1\. Fun while you’re doing it. Obviously fun, no question about it.
    
    2\. Fun afterwards. Sucks while you’re doing it, but soon afterwards, you kinda want to do it again.
    
    3\. Fun only in retrospect, after some delay. Sucks during and immediately after, but later (perhaps years/decades later), you’re glad you did it… and telling the story is fun.
    
    4\. NOT FUN. At all. Ever. You never want to repeat that experience. Maybe you learned some really hard lessons. Eventually, after you’ve had some time to heal, you realize that it sucked so damn bad that the rest of your life was made MORE fun because of it.

        This is the best scale I see on here. I lived in South Korea as a kindergarten teacher for a year. Type 3 on the Wilson scale.

    I love this! I just had type-2 fun today (but I think it will become type 1 with more practice). I can’t remember where I heard of the type 1/2/3 concept, but for me today went like:
    
    For some quick context: I’m in my early 40s and I was grossly overweight a few months back (315 at 6’0) , and am currently in the 265 range, so still plenty of weight to lose and plenty of pain when working out! It will become better…
    
    I did a 10 mile mountain bike ride today. I’ve been road bike riding a bunch (how I’ve lost a majority of my weight so far), but I have a nice little Salsa Timberjack mtb that I’ve barely touched, so as a complete mtb newb I took her for a spin.
    
    10 miles mountain bike riding is harder than 30 miles on the road! Oh lawdy was I huffing and puffing my way through! I thought I was going to die at least a handful of times – it’s an intermediate level trail (not much total beginner stuff near me) and things got pretty darn sketchy! I sloppily made it through, but there were sections where I thought my heart was going to explode, there was an area with a pretty substantial drop just to my left where I was kinda freaking out praying I didn’t mess up and topple over a root or something and send myself down, I was stupid and didn’t bring nearly enough water so I was completely parched by the end of it, and I was thanking my lucky stars when I finally made a turn and I could see the trail head parking lot again!
    
    It was actually kinda miserable at the time, but when I think back on it, it seems like it was so much fun for some reason, and I totally want to go out and do it again!
    
    All this being said, I think with more time and practice, and getting into better shape, mtb riding could definitely become type 1!

    It seems to me that Type III Fun is the opposite of Type II. Type II is fun in retrospect, Type III is fun to contemplate, but not to actually do.

    I have discovered a fourth type. Type 4 fun, “when things start to get so out of hand the funny and delusion set it. It turns into a cycle of going from 1-2-3 or 3-2-1. All that can can go wrong has gone wrong and now, ‘who would have thought could go wrong’ has been going wrong, etc. It creates amazing stories but of such unfortunate scenarios. Where rolling with the punches is all you can really cling to.

    “Also surely familiar to mothers, at least during childbirth and the dreaded teenage years.” That’s not type II fun. No one looks back at that and says that was fun.

    Hi Kelly, great article and so agree, but surely Type IV fun is the fun of not doing it at all?!! When you have that lovely self satisfaction of dodging the bullet of going out in the rain, by staying at home on the couch. Now that’s fun
