ScrapeMate Beta [![Image 1: GitHub Logo](https://github.com/hermit-crab/ScrapeMate/raw/master/icons/24.png)](https://github.com/hermit-crab/ScrapeMate/blob/master/icons/24.png)
================================================================================================================================================================================

[](https://github.com/hermit-crab/ScrapeMate#scrapemate-beta-)

Scraping assistant tool. Editing and maintaining CSS/XPath selectors across webpages.  
Available as a [Chrome/Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrapemate-beta/daiomapeacamgnofkkmiaollhidcndld) and a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scrapemate/) extensions.

Quick way to interactively pick and maintain CSS/XPath selectors and their presets for external use: website testing or scraping.

Features include:

*   Element picker (from [SelectorGadget](https://github.com/cantino/selectorgadget)).
*   List of presets ever worked on.
*   Preset JSON editor (convenient for use in conjunction with scrapy or any similar tools). Presets selective export/import.
*   Quick preview of the data currently selected.
*   Support for `::text` / `::attr()` css pseudo elements and `has-class()` xpath function.
*   Toggling JavaScript for the tab currently working on.

Planned features: nested selectors, more template testing and possibly actual extraction capabilities. See all: [TODO](https://github.com/hermit-crab/ScrapeMate/blob/master/TODO).

### Notes

[](https://github.com/hermit-crab/ScrapeMate#notes)

*   This was first intended as a bookmarklet but due to various limitations bookmarklet mode has been dropped. You can still check out outdated but somewhat working version [at this page](https://rawgit.com/Unknowny/ScrapeMate/4a60a3bd65f9445a84a5642a056801ecd85d4212/index.html).
