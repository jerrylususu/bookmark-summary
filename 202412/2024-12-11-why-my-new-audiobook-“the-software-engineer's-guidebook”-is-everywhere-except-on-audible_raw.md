A year after [The Software Engineer‚Äôs Guidebook was published](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineers-guidebook), the audiobook version is here! The good news is it‚Äôs available on ALMOST all major audiobook platforms:

*   **[Directly purchase the audiobook](https://gergelyorosz.gumroad.com/l/dlzxi)** as an m4b file and several mp3 files, sold via Gumroad. _You can upload these to any device or app you prefer to listen on. You can use apps like [BookPlayer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bookplayer/id1138219998) (iOS), [Smart Audiobook player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer&hl=en_US) (Android) and many others._
    
*   **[Spotify Audibooks](https://open.spotify.com/show/3fZG88euBSGgWx9bpsnwJG)**: _a challenger audiobook platform that offers listening up to 10 hours of free audiobook listening per month in some countries, as part of its Premium plan.

My goal with this new audiobook has been to create a product of standout quality. It took months to find the perfect narrator, [Nikola Hamilton](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/nikola-hamilton/), who‚Äôs a New York-based audio engineer, and to then create an audio version that is a great listening experience.

Today‚Äôs issue covers:

1.  **Audible‚Äôs monopoly and monopolistic practices**. Currently, Audible‚Äôs position is hurting audiobook authors. My audiobook isn‚Äôt on Audible due to a mix of their monopolistic pricing practices, and the company‚Äôs own complacency in how long they take to approve new titles.
    
2.  **Creating an audiobook.** How I went about the process, and what I learned about creating and publishing a quality audiobook.
    

Audible is a model example of a Big Tech company with an _invisible_ de facto monopoly of a market. Customers are happy, but authors and publishers are not. I suddenly find myself directly impacted by such practices that go unchallenged, and which won‚Äôt change without competition or regulation. Now is a good time to talk about that.

So, why is the audiobook of The Software Engineer's Guidebook not on Audible?

Originally, I _really_ wanted to avoid supporting a business that treats authors and publishers like only a monopolistic company can. But it‚Äôs clear that most of my readers prefer to listen on Audible. For this reason, I‚Äôve made the book available on Audible, although I recommend purchasing it anywhere _except_ there.

**However, Audible‚Äôs unusually slow approval process means my audiobook isn‚Äôt even available on Amazon‚Äôs platform, yet.** I submitted the book to Audible at the same time as I did for every other platform, six days ago. In a sign that Audible is way too comfortable in its position, they can take [up to 25 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACX/comments/15d4qi1/how_long_does_it_really_take_acx_to_review_a/) to approve new books in busy times like now ‚Äì though the official estimate from Amazon [is 14 business days](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201014330) (3 weeks). So, it will be on sale there when approval happens, likely either late 2024, or early 2025.

In 2008, Amazon [acquired](https://www.cnet.com/culture/amazon-acquires-audible-for-300-million/) audiobook startup Audible for $300M, and kept it as a separate brand while integrating it nicely with Amazon‚Äôs books and e-books features. The strategy worked wonderfully: today, Audible is the clear market leader in audiobooks. In 2022, it had a dominant, 63.4% market share in the US, [as per IbisShare](https://market.us/report/audiobooks-market/).

I ran my own survey in November last year, asking people wanting to buy the audiobook version of this:

‚ÄúWhich platform would you be interested in getting this book on?‚Äù

Following 159 responses, the results illustrated Audible dominance ‚Äì though one possibly challenged by Spotify:

[![Image 21](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67db50c2-9bd3-4710-81b2-cc560433b05e_1574x1234.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67db50c2-9bd3-4710-81b2-cc560433b05e_1574x1234.png)

77% of the 159 respondents intent on getting the audiobook marked Audible as one of their preferences (multiple selections were allowed)

It‚Äôs clear most people would prefer to use Audible. _I‚Äôm sorry that the book is not yet available ‚Äì we‚Äôre getting into Audible contributing to this._

‚ÄúTake rate‚Äù refers to the percentage of revenue a platform takes from merchants selling on it. Take rate examples:

*   **2.9%** + $0.30: the take rate Stripe [charges](https://stripe.com/en-nl/pricing) per transaction
    
*   **10%**: the take rate that Substack charges (the newsletter platform this publication uses)
    
*   **30%**: the take rate Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google Play charges. This is the take rate that the EU is investigating, and which Epic Games has noisily contested.
    
*   **30%** + data transfer fees: the take rate Amazon Kindle charges for e-books priced at $9.99 or below. _Data transfer fees refer to the cost of 3G or 4G connection to download the book ‚Äì which fee is free for the customer, but is deducted from the publisher._
    
*   **40%**: the take rate Amazon.com charges for physical goods sold on their platform, such as books
    
*   **50-60%**: the take rate book stores typically charge when selling physical books
    

When it comes to audiobooks, Audible has alarmingly high take rates:

*   **60%**: take rate for audiobooks that are exclusively on Audible, meaning they cannot be sold anywhere else.
    
*   **75%**: the take rate for non-exclusive audiobooks.
    

**A 75% take rate means authors need to sell 3x as much worth of revenue on Audible to make the same revenue as on any other platform.** Let's take a specific example: my audiobook cost about $10,000 to produce (mostly in narrator costs). Selling it as $20, how many sales would it take on Audible ‚Äì a platform with a 75% take rate ‚Äì versus on Apple Books ‚Äì one with a 30% take rate ‚Äì to break even? The numbers:

[![Image 22](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa293566b-0de8-4af8-a68b-aaa48e88261d_1816x706.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa293566b-0de8-4af8-a68b-aaa48e88261d_1816x706.png)

For the author/publisher being paid the same amount, Audible generates 7x the revenue than Apple Books, thanks to having a 75% take rate, versus a 30% one. Massive difference

Clearly, having a 75% take rate is booming business for Audible!

But how can Amazon command such sky-high take rates for what is effectively storing and streaming mp3 files, as well as building and maintaining the Audible app? It‚Äôs most likely because they dominate the market and can charge almost what they like because customers prefer Audible.

A take rate for _digital_ goods that‚Äôs above 50% is something I associate with monopolistic pricing. Already on Amazon Kindle, Amazon sets a 65% take rate for any book priced at $10 or above. So, when buying the $25.99 ebook on Amazon, Amazon makes $16.90, and the publisher (me!) gets $9.

**Monopolistic pricing is bad for consumers.** Have you noticed there are few to no ebooks priced between $10 and $20? They are either $9.99, or start from $20-21 upwards.

Amazon‚Äôs Kindle pricing policy makes it illogical to price ebooks between the $10 and $20 range because books priced between this range result in less revenue for the publisher, than if they sold the book at $9.99:

[![Image 23](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bd09127-b4dd-4382-a9f5-23976d8a9353_1822x630.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bd09127-b4dd-4382-a9f5-23976d8a9353_1822x630.png)

_A $20 Kindle book generates about as much revenue for a publisher than a $9.99 does. And for all e-books priced above $10, Amazon takes 65% of revenue_

This pricing policy most likely means e-books that would otherwise be listed in the $10-20 range, are sold to customers for $10 more.

Regarding Amazon‚Äôs Kindle hardware, two things can be argued as defences:

1.  Amazon does not ‚Äúpunish‚Äù books e-books sold outside of Amazon Kindle with a worse royalty rate
    
2.  Amazon created Kindle and its software ecosystem from scratch; a sizable investment. Without Amazon‚Äôs Kindle device, the market for e-books would likely be much smaller
    

Interestingly, Audible has a significantly higher take rate rate for audiobooks (60% or 75%) than Kindle has for e-books (30% or 65%), despite Audible not having created custom hardware for audiobooks. It has something just as valuable though: the largest exclusive collection of audiobooks!

Audible manages to maintain its lead in exclusivity by offering to lower its take rate for Audible-exclusive audiobooks. And if we assume that Audible, indeed, has 65% market share: then a publisher will probably make more money if it releases the audiobook exclusively on Audible, and gets paid 62% more per book (by being offered a 40% royalty, instead of a 25% one. Therefore, it makes $4 on a $10 audiobook, rather than $2.50).

Until Audible‚Äôs market share drops below 50%, it‚Äôs a financially bad decision to not sell audiobooks exclusively on Audible. With this tactic, Audible achieves two things at once:

*   Maintain a very high 60% take rate by dominating the audiobooks market
    
*   Strengthen its status by incentivizing audiobooks to be exclusive to Audible
    

In 2022, best-selling fantasy novel author, Brandon Sanderson, had concluded that the way Audible treats authors and publishers is unfair. He made the then unprecedented move of not releasing his latest audiobooks on Audible, at all; instead making them available for purchase directly, and putting them on Spotify. [In his words:](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2022)

> ‚ÄúBut Audible has grown to a place where it‚Äôs very bad for authors. **It‚Äôs a good company doing bad things.** (...)
> 
> They treat authors very poorly. Particularly indie authors. The deal Audible demands of them is unconscionable, and I‚Äôm hoping that providing market forces (and talking about the issue with a megaphone) will encourage change in a positive direction. (...)
> 
> Each book you buy somewhere else \[than Audible\] helps break open this field. It will lead to lower prices, fewer subscription models, and better pay for authors. Plus, these partners I‚Äôve gone to really deserve the support for being willing to try to change things.‚Äù

Sanderson‚Äôs effort to force Audible to treat authors more fairly seemed to work. A year later, Audible offered a much better financial deal for Sanderson, who took the deal, but only because Amazon said they‚Äôd roll out the same royalty structure to all authors. From Sanderson‚Äôs follow-up post:

> ‚ÄúAudible has **promised to release their new royalty system for all authors sometime in 2024**, though I should be testing it in the next month or so.
> 
> And‚Ä¶if you‚Äôll allow me a moment, I‚Äôd like to say that this feels good. It isn‚Äôt what I wanted, but I‚Äôd begun to think that nothing would ever change‚Äìthat even my voice, loud though it can be, wouldn‚Äôt be enough. Yet change IS possible.‚Äù

In July, Audible [announced](https://www.audible.com/about/newsroom/audibles-new-royalty-model-more-opportunities-for-authors-and-publishers) a new royalty model with fairer rates for authors and publishers, is coming. However, the announcement lacks specifics, and the model doesn‚Äôt apply to authors like me.

Amazon encourages authors to reach out to Audible over an email ‚Äúfor more information.‚Äù I did this, asking how I can be part of the same royalty model that was promised for all authors to come in 2024. I received no meaningful answer.

Audible has no incentive to lower its take rates. The company would be giving up revenue, and unless there‚Äôs a competitor, or a regulator, forcing them to change course, it runs counter to the company‚Äôs interests.

I predict that eventually a regulator could launch a probe into potentially anti-competitive pricing practices by Audible. But if it happens, a resolution is years away. Meanwhile, customers will face higher audiobook prices, and authors and publishers on Audible will continue to de-prioritize audiobooks due to the relatively low earnings, compared to paperbacks and e-books.

Audible is a fantastic product for customers, and Amazon has done a lot to make audiobooks more popular and widespread. Even so, it continues to treat authors and publishers poorly, offering pretty empty-looking commitments to improve things. Know that any time you purchase an audiobook on Audible, 60-75% goes directly to Amazon. On other platforms, this rate is never more than 30%. So, even if you spend the same amount on an audiobook outside of Audible, the author/publisher earns _at least_ double.

**I have no illusions about changing a Big Tech giant‚Äôs policy for audiobook authors**. This is especially true after seeing what happened with Brandon Sanderson, who [selflessly fought to secure](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/regarding-audible) a better deal for _all_ authors, only for Amazon to not change anything for most of them.

If you would like to see more and better audiobooks at more competitive prices, then purchasing audiobooks anywhere except Audible is a small thing that can, over time, make a difference.

The most straightforward way to make Audible offer fairer pricing to authors is if it faces a significant competitor which enables authors to deprioritize Audible.

Spotify is a product for which audiobooks are a pretty natural extension of its existing offering. Spotify has been aggressively investing in this area; it came up with the concept of 10 hours of free audiobooks for paying subscribers, while balancing royalties at a level well above Audible‚Äôs.

It‚Äôs strange to find myself rooting for an already giant company; Spotify is valued at $100B, in this potential audiobook battle between two titans. Still, it feels like Spotify operates with a startup mentality: they want to aggressively grow, and treat customers and authors alike as best they can. Currently, Audible is a cash cow product, where the likely business goal is to keep extracting revenue from the customer base, and to innovate as little as necessary, all while growing increasingly complacent.

**A lack of ‚Äúhustle‚Äù is visible in how Audible operates today.** As a reminder, the _primary_ reason why The Software Engineer‚Äôs Guidebook is not on Audible, but can be purchased on every other relevant marketplace, is that Audible takes 2-3x longer to approve and list an audiobook than _any_ competitor.

Are market forces gathering which will force Audible to change its ways? While we wait to find out, you can get the new audiobook of my latest title [on any of these platforms](https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy).

I hope you enjoy the audiobook of ‚ÄúThe Software Engineer's Guidebook‚Äù. It has been a long process, but I‚Äôm really happy with how the spoken word version has turned out. There are many ways to purchase this title which support myself as an author/publisher. And who knows, it should be on Audible soon, too; as and when the world‚Äôs most important audiobook platform gets around to listing it.

With the Audible question out of the way, let me share the steps I took to create the audiobook itself.

An audiobook is simply a series of mp3 files with metadata. Each file represents a part, or a chapter, of a book. For example, the structure of my audiobook is:

*   A note for the audiobook.mp3
    
*   Preface.mp3
    
*   Introduction.mp3
    
*   Part I: Developer career fundamentals.mp3
    
*   Chapter 1: Career paths.mp3
    
*   (other chapters‚Ä¶)
    
*   Chapter 26: Lifelong learning.mp3
    
*   Chapter 27: Further reading.mp3
    
*   Acknowledgments.mp3
    

The metadata contains the title, the description, keywords, ISBN number, and the additional files for the audiobook.

**ISBN number** is an interesting one for first-time authors / publishers. All books, e-books, and audiobooks need an ISBN. meaning International Standard Book Number. This number is like an [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) that is unique for not just each book, but for each edition (e.g. second edition), and format (e.g. hardcover / softcover). However, the number remains the same.

An ISBN number is surprisingly expensive: one [costs](https://www.myidentifiers.com/identify-protect-your-book/isbn/buy-isbn) around $125, but it gets cheaper when buying in bulk (e.g. 10 [costs](https://www.myidentifiers.com/identify-protect-your-book/isbn/buy-isbn) $300, and 1,000 costs $1,500, meaning the cost per number is reduced to $1.50). As a self-published author, I‚Äôm surprised by how expensive a unique number is.

ISBN numbers can be used to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù a publication to a platform. Digital publishing platforms like Amazon‚Äôs Kindle (e-book), and Spotify‚Äôs Findaway platforms offer ISBN numbers _gratis_. The catch is that ISBN numbers on platforms cannot be used to distribute elsewhere: an e-book with an ISBN number issued by Kindle cannot be used to distribute on other platforms.

Professional-grade audiobooks need to satisfy a few requirements:

*   The recording needs to meet technical specifications: 192kbps bit rate (or higher), sample rate of 44.1kHz, bit depth of 16 bits.
    
*   Recording needs to happen in a quiet place, with good-enough microphone and other recording equipment, and also decent acoustics
    
*   For nonfiction books, the tone and pace need to be constant or it‚Äôs not a great listening experience!
    

You can narrate an audiobook as a solo project, but it‚Äôs a lot of work: it takes practice to develop a ‚Äúrecording voice‚Äù for audiobooks, you need to hydrate while recording to maintain the vocal performance, and keep a steady, consistent tone and pace throughout.

Professional audiobook narrators can record 4-8 hours of material per day. Non-professionals take much longer to produce a lot less: re-recording of sentences and even individual words takes time, and one hour of ‚Äúclean‚Äù recording could take 2-3 hours to record.

I decided to hire a professional voice actor who's an expert at recording audiobooks. As a bonus, some voice professionals do the editing, too: meaning they deliver an mp3 that‚Äôs close to being the final version.

Here are popular platforms for finding narrators:

*   **[ACX](https://help.acx.com/s/article/what-is-acx)**: Amazon‚Äôs audiobook narration marketplace. It is available only for businesses registered in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, however. As my business is in the Netherlands, I was unable to use it.
    
*   **[Voices.com](http://voices.com/)**: one of the leading sites to search and audition voice actors. Sadly, I had a poor experience: after registering and posting the role for the narrator of my book, the site‚Äôs ML algorithm [immediately banned me](https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1832882636395597958). While customer support followed up two days later and apologized, I was already trialing other platforms.
    
*   **[Voquent](https://www.voquent.com/)**: This site has a dedicated team that tries to understand your project, sends demo voices, and offers auditions. You can browse and listen to samples from narrators before requesting an audition.
    
*   **[Ahab Talent](https://www.ahabtalent.com/)**: Created by one of the biggest book publishers in the world ‚Äì Penguin Random House ‚Äì initially for their own audiobook production. It‚Äôs now open to anyone creating audiobooks. Incredibly, the site does not charge audiobook creators or voice actors! It has the best selection of audiobook-focused voice actors. However, my registration took more than a week to approve.
    
*   **Posting on social media**. After I [posted on social media](https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1832882636395597958) about the frustration with Voices.com, I received messages from several narrators. The tricky part was that there is no audition process, unlike with other channels.
    

**The concept of an audition was new to me as a first-time audiobook publisher!** When narrowing down narrators based on pre-recorded samples, it‚Äôs apparently common practice to send audition requests for up to a few minutes of material, unpaid.

In my case, I tried to have as few auditions as possible by relying on pre-recorded samples. After all, auditions are additional work for these people. In the end, I had two auditions on Voquent, and two on Ahab. I found the narrator of my new audiobook book, Nikola Hamilton, on Ahab.

[![Image 24](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2233fb70-4312-4b3b-b90c-630c2805b025_1600x848.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2233fb70-4312-4b3b-b90c-630c2805b025_1600x848.png)

The interface of Ahab. It was built so book publishers can run multiple voice castings: take in lots of auditions, narrow down to a few top candidates, and then hire those folks.

**Finding the ideal voice is tricky.** I did not predict how difficult it would be to find the ‚Äúright‚Äù voice for my book. I must have listened to 300+ demos, and the biggest problem I had is that most sites offering voice actors for hire seem to specialize in shorter form voice work like adverts, and there is no way to filter voice actors who have produced at least one nonfiction audiobook. So, regardless of how I set filters, I still had 500+ matching profiles, without knowing if they were even interested in doing a lengthy audiobook.

Ahab Talent was the first site that allowed me to filter based on the number of audiobooks produced, and by the genre.

The most common payment type in the audiobook industry is a price PFH (per finished hour). PFH means the voice actor does the work of retakes and editing of the audio track, like removing pauses.

When listing a project on any platform, budget and pricing is set up front, for voice actors to know whether to invest their time in auditioning.

I offered $500 PFH on all platforms. This was after doing research that suggested the common range PFH is closer to $200-250 for less experienced narrators, and $400-500 for the more experienced.

Final audiobook length can be estimated based on wordcount. The Software Engineer's Guidebook contains 130,000 words (which is pretty long at 400 pages of above-average page size. Online calculators estimated a total listening time of around 15 hours. _In the end, this estimate was accurate to the minute: 15 hours, 9 seconds!_

The audition turnarounds took only 24 hours, and I had confirmed my narrator within hours of hearing their audition.

After finding the right voice, here‚Äôs how I proceeded:

*   **Meet-and-greet call.** We hopped on a call, where I learned more about the background of Nikola, shared context on the book, and what I wanted it to sound like. It turned out Nikola is an audio engineer in an audiobook studio, who has been recording audiobooks and narrating since 2020.
    
*   **Setting milestones.** I suggested a milestone of payments per 4 hours of recording. Nikola agreed that this is fair for both of us.
    
*   **Drafting and signing a short contract.** Contracting is outside the scope of a platform like Ahab: and it is down to the author and the narrator to strike an agreement. I asked Claude to draft a basic audiobook recording contract, which I read carefully and edited where needed, we signed, and that was that! _I find GenAI very useful for low-risk contract generation, whereas in the past I would have stuck with using an online template, or to an agreement over email._
    
*   **Feedback on each recording.** Nikola got to work and was very quick to get over recordings: he completed 4 hours of recordings every 2-3 days. I listened to them and made notes of what to re-record. These were sparse: around 1-2 sentences per section.
    
*   **Recording my voice parts.** I recorded the preface and acknowledgements. From producing the podcast, I have the right equipment, and a quiet recording area.
    
*   **Audio editing and producing the master files.** Nikola re-recorded the edits (called ‚Äúpickups‚Äù in in audiobook lingo), did audio equalisation (EQ), and ensured the final files met the specifications for the Findaway Voices platform which the audiobook is published on.
    

**Correcting the print and e-book editions was an unexpected outcome.** The audiobook recording process revealed nearly a dozen minor errors in The Software Engineer‚Äôs Guidebook, despite two additional editing passes by Dominic, the hawk-eyed editor who edits The Pragmatic Engineer. Most were nuanced and almost impossible to spot unless thoroughly reading the book ‚Äì or, in this case, hearing every word!

With the mp3 files recorded and complete, I needed to decide where to submit the audiobook for distribution. The options were:

*   **Register to each site/marketplace separately.** Register to ACX (working around the region requirement, somehow), to Spotify as a publisher, Apple Books, Google Play, and many others. This seemed like a lot of work. Also, being based in the Netherlands, the KYC (know your customer) checks were likely to be lengthy at some of these places.
    
*   **Use [PublishDrive](https://publishdrive.com/)**. This is an e-book and audiobook distribution platform I use to distribute my e-books for platforms other than Kindle. They support all major audiobook marketplaces.
    
*   **Use [Findaway Voices](https://www.findawayvoices.com/) by Spotify**. Also an audiobook distribution platform. The platform pays out [100% of royalties from Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/findawayvoices/article/royalty-rates/) (meaning Spotify has a 0% take rate, for now that is) and 80% from other platforms.
    

In the end, I chose Findaway Voices, thanks to its first-class support for Spotify. Also, I‚Äôd like to support Spotify as a much-needed challenger to Audible‚Äôs monopolistic pricing practices.

I had to do a few more things before submitting the audiobook:

*   **Create a cover image.** As with all my book covers in the past, I used Canva.
    
*   **Fill out metadata.** The same as the e-book edition. For ISBN, I used my own ISBN from a previously-purchased batch of 10.
    
*   **Pricing.** An interesting aspect of pricing is ‚Äúlibrary pricing.‚Äù Book lenders buy audiobooks at a different (higher) price, and then lend the books out, one at a time. The suggested rate is 2-3x the retail book price. I set my retail list price to $19.99 and my library list price to $40. _Actual prices may drop when platforms lower their take rate, as I understand._
    

After submitting, it takes up to a week for Findaway Voices to approve a book. _In my case, this was cut to a day, likely due to having direct contact with the Spotify Audiobooks team, who reached out after hearing that an audiobook version of The Software Engineer's Guidebook was to be published._

With that, the audiobook was set to ‚Äúgo live‚Äù on the agreed publishing date, **which is today!** You can listen to a sample and [get the 15-hour-long audiobook](https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy), here. (Print and ebook versions [also available](https://www.engguidebook.com/).)
