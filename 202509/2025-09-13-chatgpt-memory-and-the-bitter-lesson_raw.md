We know why memory is important for ChatGPT. A super-assistant that people use for everything from search to learning to programming to therapy isn't particularly useful if it can't remember things about them. Memory also creates lock-in: every conversation makes the service more valuable and harder to leave.

Earlier this year, ChatGPT's received what Sam Altman called his "favorite feature"—a major upgrade to how its memory system works. Despite millions using it daily, the actual architecture is surprisingly under-discussed. How does memory work? What does ChatGPT store? How often does it update?

I spent the past few days reverse-engineering ChatGPT's memory system. In this post, I'll walk through each component, show you exactly what data is stored about you, and then share some thoughts on OpenAI's approach and where memory is headed.

_Most of this was uncovered by simply asking ChatGPT directly. Throughout this article, I've shared the exact prompts you can use to explore your own ChatGPT memory. Where privacy allows, I've also included links to my actual ChatGPT conversations._

The Components
--------------

At the time of writing, ChatGPT exposes four buckets of information about a user alongside the system prompt:

1.   Interaction Metadata
2.   Recent Conversation Context
3.   Model Set Context
4.   User Knowledge Memories

Let's look at each of these in detail.

Interaction Metadata
--------------------

This is the relatively boring component of ChatGPT's memory system.

ChatGPT provides the model with a comprehensive set of metadata about how you interact with the service. According to the system's own description, this data is "auto-generated from the user's request activity." It includes device information (screen dimensions, pixel ratio, browser/OS details, dark/light mode preference) and usage patterns (topic preferences, message length, conversation depth, model usage, and recent activity levels).

What makes this data interesting is that ChatGPT isn't given explicit instructions on how to use it. Yet it's easy to imagine how increasingly sophisticated LLMs might leverage these patterns. When I ask "[My camera isn't working, what should I do?](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b9c147-09bc-8001-b633-056503ba2621)" ChatGPT gives me iPhone-specific instructions without needing to ask whether I'm using iPhone or Android. Similarly, my usage statistics say that I use thinking models 77% of the time versus non-thinking ones. Based on this, ChatGPT might direct me to thinking models more often in auto mode.

This metadata varies by platform—the mobile app captures different information than the web interface, meaning ChatGPT can behave different depending on which device you're using.

Recent Conversation Content
---------------------------

Recent Conversation Content is a history of your latest conversations with ChatGPT, each timestamped with topic and selected messages. In my case, the 40 most recent conversations were included. Interestingly, only the user's messages are surfaced, not the assistant's responses.

This "continuity log" bridges past discussions to the current one. While there aren't explicit instructions about how to use this data, we can speculate about why OpenAI includes it. With millions of users, they've likely observed patterns in how people interact with ChatGPT—perhaps noticing that users often work through related problems across multiple conversations without explicitly connecting them.

Providing this conversation history might help ChatGPT deliver more relevant responses. For instance, if someone spent three conversations researching flights to Tokyo, comparing hotels, and checking visa requirements, then returns asking "what about the weather there in March?"—ChatGPT could potentially infer "there" means Tokyo rather than needing clarification.

The choice to include only user messages could make sense for practical reasons. Perhaps OpenAI found that user messages alone provide sufficient context, or they're simply managing token limits—assistant responses tend to be much longer than user queries, so including them might bloat the context window without adding proportional value.

Model Set Context
-----------------

Model Set Context is an extension of the memory feature ChatGPT first introduced in February 2024. When you tell ChatGPT "I'm allergic to shellfish," it stores this as a memory item that gets provided to the model with every prompt. These memories are stored as short, timestamped entries—typically single sentences.

Users have full control over these memories. Through the settings interface, they can view and delete entries. To add or edit memories, they need to tell ChatGPT directly in conversation. Unlike the other three memory modules, everything in Model Set Context is transparent and directly manageable by the user.

When conflicts arise between memory modules, Model Set Context takes precedence. It functions as the "source of truth"—like a patch layer that can override information from other modules. This makes sense: if you explicitly tell ChatGPT something, that should supersede any conflicting data it might have gathered elsewhere.

User Knowledge Memories
-----------------------

User Knowledge Memories represent the newest and most interesting component of ChatGPT's memory system. These are dense, AI-generated summaries that OpenAI periodically generates from conversation history. Unlike Model Set Context, these are neither visible in the settings nor directly editable by users.

In my case, ChatGPT has condensed hundreds of conversations into 10 detailed paragraphs. Here's one of those entries:

> You are an avid traveler and planner, frequently organizing detailed multi-day itineraries and budgets for trips: you have documented extensive travel plans and experiences for Bali (Aug 2024), Koh Phangan/Koh Tao (May–June 2025), San Francisco (June–July 2025), Yosemite/North Fork (July 2025), Big Sur/Monterey (July 2025), and upcoming Japan (Oct–Nov 2025) and Shey Phoksundo trek (Nov 2025), often specifying budgets, gear lists (e.g., Osprey vs Granite Gear backpacks, Salomon vs Merrell shoes, etc.), local transport (ferries, buses, rental cars, etc.), and photography gear (Sony A7III, DJI Mini 4 Pro, etc.), and you meticulously track costs (fuel, hostels, rental insurance, etc.) and logistics (e.g., Hertz/Enterprise rental policies, hostel bookings, etc.).

The information density is striking: specific dates, brand preferences, budget habits, technical specifications—months of interactions distilled into interconnected knowledge blocks. The other nine paragraphs show similar depth across domains, from coding projects with technical stack details to writing frameworks like "Ben Thompson-style strategy arcs," from fitness routines to financial tracking.

After examining user knowledge memories for two users, a pattern emerged: the first three paragraphs focused on professional life—work, coding projects, technical skills—while the final two specifically describe how users interact with ChatGPT itself. This consistent structure suggests OpenAI provides specific guidance on what to capture and how to organize these memories.

The module is updated periodically, synthesizing information from new conversations since the last update. The exact update cadence remains unclear. I've been tracking them daily—they remained static for two days, then changed on Saturday. I'm monitoring across multiple accounts to identify the cadence and will report back if I establish one.

While incredibly dense with information, these memories aren't perfectly accurate. They mix outdated facts with enduring truths. The memory block above mentions I'm planning trips to Japan and Nepal in late 2025—those never happened, I was just exploring options. Another block says I'm actively working on [a coding project I've long since abandoned](https://www.shloked.com/writing/posts/7-lessons-from-launching-my-first-ai-product).

The gap is understandable. When I was exploring Japan, I had reason to discuss it with ChatGPT. When I decided not to go? There was no reason to bring it up. ChatGPT has no way to detect that plans changed or projects ended—these "facts" persist indefinitely unless explicitly corrected through Model Set Context.

Despite the inaccuracies, the memories remain powerful because they capture patterns, not just facts. ChatGPT knows I prefer Airbnbs, track expenses meticulously, and love Next.js—truths that persist even if specific trips never happened or projects were abandoned.

How it all fits together
------------------------

I'm going to make a crazy analogy here, but please bear with me for a moment: ChatGPT's memory system is structured very similarly to how an LLM itself is trained.

Start with the base model. You pretrain on a huge corpus and compress it into dense weights. It's powerful, but expensive to train and frozen in time. That's what **User Knowledge Memories** feel like. They're dense, AI-generated summaries distilled from hundreds of your conversations. They do the heavy lifting—recalling projects, stacks, routines, and preferences—but they age. So they may still "believe" you're planning that Japan trip unless something explicitly corrects them.

Then come the steering layers:

*   **Model Set Context** ≈ RLHF: explicit, user-provided instructions that override stale or incorrect base knowledge ("Actually, I'm allergic to shellfish now.").

*   **Recent Conversation Content** ≈ in-context learning: fresh examples that shape behavior in the moment, without rewriting the base.

*   **Interaction Metadata** ≈ system defaults: environment and usage signals that nudge behavior without changing what the system "knows."

OpenAI can't keep retraining a base model in real time, so it relies on these layers to keep the system current and well-behaved. Likewise, ChatGPT doesn't continuously refresh your User Knowledge Memories; it leans on your explicit updates and recent context. In practice, you're the curator of your training data _and_ the RLHF provider—constantly steering a powerful, partially opaque base.

It's an analogy, not a perfect mapping, but it's useful.

The Bitter Lesson
-----------------

We've looked at what's there in ChatGPT's memory architecture; now let's look at what isn't. No extraction of individual memories. No vector databases. No knowledge graphs. No RAG.

While most memory solutions build upon these complex retrieval systems—carefully selecting which memories to surface for each query—OpenAI just includes everything with every message. Your compressed User Knowledge Memories, Model Set Context, recent conversations, metadata. All of it, every time.

The technical heavy lifting isn't happening in the memory system at all. Even the AI-powered summarization that creates User Knowledge Memories isn't technically complex—it's likely just expensive at scale. The real work happens in making the models themselves more powerful, then reaping those benefits across everything, memory included.

OpenAI is making two specific bets:

First, that models are smart enough to handle irrelevant context. When you ask about Python debugging, ChatGPT doesn't need a retrieval system to know your travel plans aren't relevant. It can parse thousands of tokens and focus on what matters.

Second, that context windows will keep growing while costs keep falling. Including all memory components regardless of relevance seems wasteful today but becomes trivial when context is cheap.

The bitter lesson strikes again. While others build sophisticated scaffolding around models, OpenAI is betting that stronger models with more compute will obviate the need for clever engineering.

Looking forward, the obvious next step is more frequent memory updates. Right now, those User Knowledge Memories are relatively static—expensive to regenerate means they age poorly. But as costs drop, we'll likely see continuous or near-continuous updates.

The bigger challenge isn't technical—it's product-level. How does ChatGPT detect when facts become outdated? How does it validate memories against reality? How does it try to understand parts of your life that you don't normally talk to it about? These problems can't be solved with better models or cheaper compute. They require rethinking how memory and conversation interact, and what role ChatGPT plays in users' lives.

What's Next
-----------

I'm fascinated by how memory is evolving in ChatGPT and AI systems broadly—technically, philosophically, and ethically. User Knowledge Memories represent a turning point: for the first time, ChatGPT is processing your conversations behind the scenes and storing insights about you that aren't easily visible. What are the second and third-order effects of AI systems building such profiles of their users?

The space is moving incredibly fast. ChatGPT recently also announced project-specific memories. Anthropic and others are building their own approaches. There is no playbook. Each implementation builds off different assumptions about what matters, what should be remembered, and who controls that memory.

I'll keep going down this rabbit hole—exploring how different platforms approach memory, tracking new developments, and thinking through the implications. If you're interested in following along, subscribe below.
