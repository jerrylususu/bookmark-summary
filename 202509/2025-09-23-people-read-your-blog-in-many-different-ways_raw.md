Markdown Content:
I read a lot of tech blog posts and have [written a few of my own](https://evanhahn.com/blog/). I think a lot about the varied ways people read.

How _thoroughly_ do people read?

*   Some readers **read every word** from start to finish. (I suspect this is rare.)
*   Some readers **skim**.
*   Some readers **don’t read your post at all**.

How much of the _language_ do they understand?

*   Some readers read in **a language they’re fluent in**.
*   Some readers read in **a language they understand, but not fluently**.
*   Some readers read an **automated translation** because they don’t speak the language.
*   Some readers have **great vocabularies** and understand when you use words like “[synecdoche](https://www.wordnik.com/words/synecdoche)”.
*   Some readers have **smaller vocabularies** and benefit from simpler words. (This is me.)

What _software_ are readers using to consume your post?

*   Readers use **varying screen sizes**. Phones, laptops, tablets, maybe even refrigerators.
*   Readers use **varying font sizes**. For example, I increase my display’s font size for readability.
*   Some readers **listen** to your post with text-to-speech.
*   Some readers use a **“reader mode”** to remove distractions.
*   Some readers are reading your post in an **RSS reader** or **email inbox**.
*   Some readers read with a **braille display**.

What _format_ are people reading?

*   Some readers read **the original version of your writing**.
*   Some readers read **a computer-generated summary**.
*   Some people are experiencing **a copy of your content**. [(This happened to me.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rdo8KAHgoE)

What might make it _difficult_ for someone to read your post?

*   Some people have **disabilities** that make it harder to read. Some of these disabilities are permanent and others are temporary.
*   Some people are in a **mental state** that makes it harder to read. Maybe they’re tired or overworked.
*   Some readers have **slow or unreliable connections**.
*   Some readers **disable JavaScript** which might break your site.

_Who_ is reading your post?

*   Some readers are **human people**.
*   Some readers are **search engine scrapers**.
*   Some readers are **training machine learning models**.
*   Some readers are **saving a copy for preservation**, such as the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).
*   Most people are not reading your post.

I’m not an expert at this, but I try to keep all this in mind while I write. I try to use simple, short English. I like headings and emphasis for easy skimming. I refer to [“Writing for Web Accessibility”](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/) as a resource. But I still have a lot to improve!
