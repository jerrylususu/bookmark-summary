Introduction
------------

I still remember the fall of 2008 when Google launched Chrome - a quirky new browser with a comic book as its press release. As someone who’s spent a long time on the Chrome team, I’ve watched this project grow from a secret skunkworks to a browser used by billions. Chrome turns 17 this week, and it feels like a good time to reflect on how far we’ve come in terms of Chrome’s guiding principles: **speed, security, stability, and simplicity**[[1]](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/how-we-designed-chrome-10-years-ago.html). In this write-up, I’ll walk through Chrome’s origins and evolution across these pillars (as best I know them), highlight key milestones (from multi-process architecture to AI-powered features), and share a few behind-the-scenes tidbits along the way. It’s been an incredible journey - one driven by relentless performance improvements, cutting-edge security efforts, and an uncompromising focus on user experience. Let’s dive in!

On September 2, 2008, Google released the beta version of Google Chrome’s browser for Windows. In December 2008, the first stable version of Google Chrome 1.0 was released.

Origins of Chrome: A fresh start for the web
--------------------------------------------

Back in the mid-2000s, web browsers were struggling to keep up with the modern web. Google’s founders saw the browser as critical (“our entire business is people using a browser to access us and the Web” as CEO Eric Schmidt recalled[[2]](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/mf-chrome/#:~:text=Why%20is%20Google%20building%20a,access%20us%20and%20the%20Web)), yet the incumbents weren’t architected for rich web apps. In 2006, a small team of ex-Firefox engineers at Google - led by Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher - started sketching ideas for a new browser built for the “cloud era.” They concluded that only a ground-up redesign could meet the moment[[3]](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/mf-chrome/#:~:text=When%20Microsoft%27s%20Internet%20Explorer%20and,Firefox%20developer%2C%20you%20love%20to). Google hired talent like Goodger, Fisher, and engineering director Linus Upson (who had browser pedigree from Netscape and Firefox) to start prototyping[[4]](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/mf-chrome/#:~:text=But%20behind%20the%20scenes%2C%20the,of%20doing%20a%20great%20browser).

One _huge_ idea emerged: **isolating tabs into separate processes**. Traditional browsers ran everything in one process/thread, which made them fragile and slow as web pages got more dynamic[[5]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=for%20robustness%2C%20responsiveness%2C%20and%20security,take%20over%20your%20entire%20computer). The Chrome team envisioned a browser that functioned more like an operating system: each tab or web app would run in its own sandboxed process, with the browser coordinating between them[[6]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=this%20is%20a%20game%20changer,the%20world%20of%20web%20development)[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20takes%20advantage%20of,if%20an%20exploit%20does%20occur). This multi-process architecture promised better robustness (a crash in one tab wouldn’t take down others) and security (each tab’s access to the system would be restricted)[[5]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=for%20robustness%2C%20responsiveness%2C%20and%20security,take%20over%20your%20entire%20computer)[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20takes%20advantage%20of,if%20an%20exploit%20does%20occur). It was a radical departure, but one that could **“make the browser more robust, responsive, and secure”** than the single-process model[[8]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=For%20all%20of%20these%20reasons%2C,secure%20than%20single%20process%20browsers). At the same time, the team built a brand new JavaScript engine, **V8**, from scratch to dramatically speed up web applications.

Eric Schmidt on how the Chrome browser came into being with Larry and Sergei “encouraging” it.

Google Chrome’s debut on September 2, 2008 - accompanied by a [comic](https://www.scottmccloud.com/googlechrome/) by Scott McCloud - was a breath of fresh air. Sundar Pichai (then Chrome’s product lead, now Google’s CEO) said on launch eve that he wanted “many millions” of people to use it, _“I want my mom to use it. I want my dad to use it.”_[[9]](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/mf-chrome/#:~:text=On%20the%20eve%20of%20the,my%20dad%20to%20use%20it) That ambition wasn’t misplaced: by rethinking the browser’s core design, Chrome set the stage for the next decade of web innovation. In the sections that follow, we’ll explore how Chrome delivered on its four “S” principles (speed, security, stability, simplicity) and beyond, from performance gains to AI-assisted browsing.

Speed: faster than a speeding…blink? :)
---------------------------------------

**“Chrome has always been about speed”** as we like to say[[10]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=Chrome%20has%20always%20been%20about,to%20make%20Chrome%20even%20faster). Performance was a driving force from day one - after all, a fast web benefits both users and Google’s own services. The early bet on V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, paid off immediately: by compiling JS to native machine code and using techniques like hidden classes and inline caches, V8 made web apps _“very, very fast”_[[11]](https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/29566.html#:~:text=Bak%20says%20there%20are%20three,property%20access%20and%20function%20calls). In fact, at launch V8 could run JS **tens of times faster** than in other browsers of the time[[12]](https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/29566.html#:~:text=Without%20V8%2C%20Javascript%20suffers%20from,can%20run%20inside%20a%20browser)[[13]](https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/29566.html#:~:text=Bak%20says%20there%20are%20three,property%20access%20and%20function%20calls). This unlocked a whole new class of rich web applications that previously felt sluggish. As an early article noted, _“for the first time, it is now possible to develop serious functionality inside a web browser without relying on obese plugins”_[[11]](https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/29566.html#:~:text=Bak%20says%20there%20are%20three,property%20access%20and%20function%20calls). Chrome’s speedy JS and multi-process rendering meant even complex apps like Gmail ran smoother than before.

Over the years, Chrome’s quest for speed never let up. We overhauled our entire rendering pipeline multiple times. For example, in 2017-2019 the V8 team introduced a new multi-tier JIT compilation pipeline (Ignition, Turbofan, and later Sparkplug/Maglev), which significantly boosted real-world JS performance[[14]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=,both%20performance%20and%20power%20consumption). We constantly profile and optimize hotspots: everything from DOM manipulation and CSS parsing to font rendering has been tuned. By mid-2024, these efforts yielded a **72% increase in Chrome’s Speedometer benchmark score** (a broad measure of web app responsiveness) since work began on the Speedometer 3 test in 2022[[15]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/06/how-chrome-achieved-highest-score-ever.html#:~:text=score%20ever%20Speedometer%203%2C%20by,performance%20gains%20for%20our%20users). In other words, Chrome today does in 1 second what might have taken nearly 2 seconds a couple years ago - a massive gain in a short time.

One recent brag-worthy milestone: in June 2025, Chrome hit the **highest score ever on the Speedometer 3.1 benchmark**, after a focused push on performance[[16]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=Performance%20has%20always%20been%20one,ever%20on%20the%20Speedometer%20benchmark)[[17]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=For%20Speedometer%2C%20these%20optimizations%20have,to%20load%20and%20do%20things). Over just the previous year, we squeezed out another 22% improvement on Speedometer through deep optimizations in Blink and V8[[18]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=the%20highest%20score%20ever%20on,the%20Speedometer%20benchmark). This involved everything from _“heavily optimized memory layouts”_ in DOM/CSS data structures to smarter caching and task scheduling in the renderer[[19]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=across%20the%20entire%20stack,are%20some%20notable%20optimization%20examples)[[20]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=Strings%20in%20the%20renderer%20improved,hashes%2C%20filters%2C%20and%20probing%20algorithms). The cumulative effect is huge - we calculated that if each Chrome user browses 10 minutes a day, these recent improvements save **116 million hours** of waiting for pages to load, “roughly 166 lifetimes” saved per year[[17]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=For%20Speedometer%2C%20these%20optimizations%20have,to%20load%20and%20do%20things)!

![Image 2](https://addyosmani.com/assets/images/speedometer-31.png)

_Chrome’s ongoing performance optimizations yielded record-breaking Speedometer 3.1 benchmark scores in 2025[[17]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=For%20Speedometer%2C%20these%20optimizations%20have,to%20load%20and%20do%20things). Each incremental improvement - from faster JavaScript engines to smarter rendering pipelines - adds up to a significantly snappier browsing experience for users._

Chrome’s speed gains aren’t just on high-end desktops; we’ve worked hard to improve performance on _all_ devices, including resource-constrained mobiles. In 2023-2024, for instance, Chrome on Android saw **Speedometer 2.1 scores double** on many devices after we introduced a specialized 64-bit “high performance” build for modern phones[[21]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=Since%20the%20release%20of%20Chrome,our%20silicon%20and%20SoC%20partners)[[22]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=With%20M113%2C%20Chrome%20was%20finally,into%20the%20new%20premium%20build). By allowing a larger binary and using modern compiler optimizations (O2/O3, more inlining, PGO), the Android team unlocked huge gains on flagship chips[[23]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=%2A%20By%20targeting%2064,while%20updating%20the%20model%20and)[[24]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=code%20chromiumdash.appspot.com%20.%20,used%20to%20generate%20the%20orderfile). We collaborated with SoC partners like ARM and Qualcomm to tune Chrome to the silicon, yielding up to _“60-80% improvement in Speedometer 3.0”_ on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform[[25]](https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html#:~:text=We%20worked%20closely%20with%20our,PGO%20and%20opportunities%20in%20V8). In practical terms, that means smoother scrolling, more responsive taps, and less jank on mobile - something you really feel in everyday browsing.

Speed isn’t only about JavaScript either. Chrome aggressively tackles every source of latency: **networking** (we pioneered the SPDY protocol which became HTTP/2, and QUIC which became HTTP/3), **page load pipeline** (e.g. prerendering pages in the background for near-instant loads[[26]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=median%20LCP%20improvement%20on%20Android%2FDesktop%2C,user%20engagement%20and%20ecosystem%20health)), and **user perception** (e.g. measuring _Largest Contentful Paint_ and optimizing toward it[[27]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=We%20examined%20millions%20of%20pages,discuss%20in%20this%20blog%20post)[[28]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=Exponential%20Impact%20of%20Small%20Changes)). A recent example is Chrome’s work on **Core Web Vitals (CWV)** - metrics like LCP (loading), INP (interaction) and CLS (stability) - which we not only advocated as standards but also used internally to guide performance improvements[[29]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20we%20introduced%20Web,ecosystem%20to%20enable%20this%20achievement)[[28]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=Exponential%20Impact%20of%20Small%20Changes). By identifying common bottlenecks in real sites (via the Chrome User Experience Report) and systematically addressing them, Chrome helped the web get faster. In fact, since CWV’s introduction in 2020, _“the average page load in Chrome is now 166 ms faster”_ and over 40% of sites now pass all the vitals, leading to **10,000+ years of cumulative time saved** for users in 2023 alone[[28]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=Exponential%20Impact%20of%20Small%20Changes)[[30]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=Image). Small changes add up: one feature that preconnects to sites on link click (pointer down) shaved ~60 ms off median LCP[[31]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,user%20engagement%20and%20ecosystem%20health), another that **back/forward caches** pages makes returning to previous pages instant for millions of navigations[[32]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20proud%20to%20highlight%20numerous,ways%20we%E2%80%99ve%20optimized%20performance). We often joke that performance work is never done - there’s always another 10 ms to chase - but these efforts truly pay off in a faster, smoother web for everyone. And if you want proof, just look at the competition: we’ve seen a healthy performance race in the browser industry, with all modern browsers now vastly faster than 2000s-era ones[[33]](https://thenextweb.com/news/google-marks-chromes-3rd-birthday-with-a-nifty-interactive-infographic#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D). That’s a win for users and developers alike.

Security: protecting users when it matters most
-----------------------------------------------

Chrome’s security approach has always been _“defense in depth.”_ We recognized early that a browser’s job is to safely run untrusted code from the internet on your machine - a scary proposition! So we invested in multiple layers of protection, many of which have since become industry standards. The first line of defense was Chrome’s sandbox and multi-process design. As WIRED put it on Chrome’s 10th birthday, Chrome _“managed tabs in a new way; its ‘sandbox’ made each one run with its own permissions and protected memory”_, so a malicious page in one tab couldn’t hijack the whole browser[[6]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=this%20is%20a%20game%20changer,the%20world%20of%20web%20development)[[34]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=Crucially%2C%20Chrome%20managed%20tabs%20in,all%20program). In the late 2000s, “drive-by” malware downloads were rampant - simply visiting a hacked site could infect your PC via a browser exploit[[35]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=,confine%20that%20within%20the%20sandbox). Chrome’s sandbox aimed to contain such exploits. If an attacker found a vulnerability in our rendering engine, the sandbox process limits meant they’d be _“confined”_ to that tab with very limited access, unable to install malware or read data from other sites[[36]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=On%20top%20of%20this%2C%20the,install%20malware%20on%20your%20computer)[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20takes%20advantage%20of,if%20an%20exploit%20does%20occur). As Chrome engineer Justin Schuh noted, auto-updates (to patch vulns quickly) and the sandbox were the two **“big pieces”** in Chrome’s original design to combat malware[[35]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=,confine%20that%20within%20the%20sandbox). These features were novel (even controversial) at launch - some in the community worried auto-updating browsers took away user control[[37]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=These%20features%20that%20set%20Chrome,actually%20makes%20sense%20for%20browsers) - but time proved their worth. Today, automatic updates and sandboxed processes are table stakes for browser security, thanks in part to Chrome’s success with them[[37]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=These%20features%20that%20set%20Chrome,actually%20makes%20sense%20for%20browsers).

![Image 4](https://addyosmani.com/assets/images/site-isolation.webp)

_Illustration of Chrome’s Site Isolation feature (Source: Google). With Site Isolation enabled, each website (and even cross-origin iframes) runs in a separate sandboxed process[[38]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome\_site\_isolation/#:~:text=%3E%20Speculative%20execution%20side,for%20all%20desktop%20Chrome%20users)[[39]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome\_site\_isolation/#:~:text=,several%20years%2C%20independently%20of%20Spectre). This extra partitioning provides strong defenses against attacks like Spectre that try to steal data across origins._

Chrome’s security team (led by folks like **Parisa Tabriz**, affectionately known as Google’s “Security Princess” prior to her becoming our VP [[40]](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/awards/alumni-awards/alumni-awards-past-recipients/parisa-tabriz#:~:text=Illinois%20siebelschool,the%20Chrome%2FChromium%20Security%20engineering%20team)) has never let up on hardening the browser. We run perhaps the industry’s most aggressive vulnerability rewards program with large sums paid out to researchers by 2018[[41]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=Though%20Google%20is%20obviously%20aggressive,researchers%20who%20submit%20Chrome%20vulnerabilities), and much more since - to find and fix bugs before attackers do. We’ve relentlessly worked to eliminate entire classes of vulns. For example, ~70% of serious Chrome bugs have historically been memory safety issues (use-after-free, etc.), so we’ve explored solutions like **integrating memory-safe languages (Rust)** into Chromium[[42]](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html#:~:text=Why%20We%20Chose%20to%20Bring,Rust%20into%20Chromium)[[43]](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html#:~:text=Rust%20was%20developed%20by%20Mozilla,safety%20while%20also%20being%20performant). In 2023 we began supporting parts of Chromium in Rust to reduce the chance of certain bugs entirely[[42]](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html#:~:text=Why%20We%20Chose%20to%20Bring,Rust%20into%20Chromium). We’ve also built technologies like _MiraclePtr_ (a variant of tagged pointers) to detect use-after-free bugs at runtime in C++ components. The war on memory unsafety is ongoing, but we’re making progress on that front too.

One of Chrome’s biggest security leaps came in 2018 with **Site Isolation**. This project, years in the making, took our original multi-process idea _even further_: instead of one process per tab, Chrome would use one process per **website origin** (and even isolate cross-site iframes into their own processes)[[44]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=With%20Site%20Isolation%20is%20enabled%2C,displaying%20pages%20from%20other%20domains)[[39]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=,several%20years%2C%20independently%20of%20Spectre). This is a huge architectural change - effectively **“splitting a single page across multiple processes”** for security’s sake[[39]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=,several%20years%2C%20independently%20of%20Spectre). It wasn’t easy (it required solving lots of process coordination issues and did incur a memory cost), but it paid off enormously when the Spectre CPU vulnerability hit. Site Isolation, which Chrome enabled by default for 99% of desktop users in v67[[38]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=%3E%20Speculative%20execution%20side,for%20all%20desktop%20Chrome%20users)[[45]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=Site%20Isolation%20changes%20Chrome%27s%20behaviour,monitor%20and%20improve%20performance), meant that even a Spectre attack leaking memory could only read data from the _same site’s_ process, not from other sites’ content. Google had actually pursued Site Isolation as a general security measure _“for several years, independently of Spectre”_ but the Spectre crisis validated the approach and accelerated site isolation on by default[[46]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=In%20its%20blog%20post%2C%20Google,before%20Spectre%20appeared%20in%20January)[[45]](https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/12/chrome_site_isolation/#:~:text=Site%20Isolation%20changes%20Chrome%27s%20behaviour,monitor%20and%20improve%20performance). This change tightened the sandbox boundaries from per-tab to per-site. As a result, Chrome today provides significantly improved isolation between sites - one site’s code (even if compromised) faces substantial barriers to accessing another’s data, though no security system is absolute. It’s a bit like having each website live in its own mini-VM. We continue to work on extending this to Android (where low memory makes it trickier, but we’re getting there)[[47]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=The%20security%20team%20specifically%20plans,would%20be%20a%20safer%20bet).

Security isn’t just under the hood - Chrome also works to directly protect users from social engineering and other threats. Early on we integrated Google’s **Safe Browsing** service to warn users of phishing or malware sites. Those red warning pages have prevented countless scams. In recent years, we’ve enhanced these protections with on-device machine learning. For example, Chrome uses a local ML model to detect _phishing_ pages by analyzing color profiles and URL cues in real time - this helped Chrome _“better detect malicious sites”_ and flag them to users[[48]](https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-generative-ai-features-january-2024/#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20few%20years%2C,and%20generate%20the%20%2066). We’ve also tackled the plague of abusive notifications and pop-ups using ML. A recent Chromium blog explains how Chrome on Android now uses an **on-device ML model (trained with help from Google’s Gemini AI)** to flag suspicious notifications - those that might be phishing attempts or scams - and warn the user[[49]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20a%20local%2C%20on,body%2C%20and%20action%20button%20texts)[[50]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=device%20and%20notification%20contents%20are,other%20platforms%20in%20the%20future). The model runs locally (notification content is never sent to Google), and it was trained on synthetic data generated by a large language model plus human review[[50]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=device%20and%20notification%20contents%20are,other%20platforms%20in%20the%20future). This is a neat example of AI assisting security: Chrome can _“detect and warn you about potentially deceptive or spammy notifications”_ in real time[[49]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20a%20local%2C%20on,body%2C%20and%20action%20button%20texts)[[51]](https://blog.chromium.org/#:~:text=against%20potentially%20harmful%20notifications%20include%3A).

Chrome’s **password manager** is another unsung hero for security. We not only generate and store strong passwords for users, but also check credentials against known breaches. Starting around 2019, Chrome began warning if your saved passwords appeared in a public leak (via encrypted check against Google’s breach database) - nudging countless people to safer credentials. We made password management seamless across desktop and mobile, autofilling with one click, so fewer people reuse weak passwords. And Chrome’s Safety Check now even flags _extensions_ that might be malicious or unmaintained[[52]](https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/#:~:text=On%20the%20security%20front%2C%20we%E2%80%99ve,teams%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions), an important extension ecosystem safeguard introduced in the 15th birthday update.

Perhaps Chrome’s biggest impact on user security has been our push for **HTTPS everywhere**. In the late 2000s, most websites were still HTTP by default. Over the past decade, Chrome joined forces with other browsers and organizations to change that. We made HTTPS easier (helping projects like Let’s Encrypt) and gradually applied pressure: first by marking sites as “Not Secure” if they were HTTP (since 2017)[[53]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=A%20more%20recent%20focus%3A%20advocating,traffic%20is%20protected%20by%20HTTPS), and eventually planning to block or downgrade non-secure content. The result? As of a few years ago, _“77% of all Chrome traffic is protected by HTTPS”_[[53]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=A%20more%20recent%20focus%3A%20advocating,traffic%20is%20protected%20by%20HTTPS) (and it’s likely higher now). We decided, as Chrome security manager Adrienne Porter Felt said, _“we’re going to help make the whole web encrypted”_ - even if that meant prodding sites and dealing with some criticism[[54]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=,within%20our%20own%20company%20initially)[[55]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=,make%20the%20whole%20web%20encrypted). It worked: today, encryption is the norm, and users are safer from eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks. Chrome also pioneered features like mixed content blocking (to prevent HTTPS pages from pulling in insecure subresources) and Privacy Sandbox initiatives. While Chrome originally planned to phase out third-party cookies, Google reversed this decision in July 2024. Instead, Privacy Sandbox APIs now serve as optional privacy-preserving alternatives that websites can adopt while third-party cookies remain supported with enhanced user controls.

Finally, we continuously try to make advanced security usable. Take **Incognito Mode** - Chrome introduced this private browsing mode at launch in 2008, normalizing the concept of not leaving traces for a session (useful for shared computers or any time you don’t want history/cookies saved). Or our recent integration of secure _Web Authentication_ (allowing use of security keys or phone-based passkeys in Chrome for phishing-resistant login). Our philosophy has been to bake in security features by default (auto-update, sandbox, Safe Browsing) and make them invisible until needed, so users stay safe without extra effort. As I reflect on 17 years, I’m proud that Chrome has _“redefined security online”_ in many ways[[56]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=How%20Google%20Chrome%20Spent%20a,Making%20the%20Web%20More%20Secure)[[57]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=Google%20developers%20didn%27t%20invent%20every,and%20more%20reliable%20browsing%20experience). And we’re not done - our security folks are now eyeing things like reimagining URLs for better identity (to combat phishing)[[58]](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-decade-making-the-web-more-secure/#:~:text=Perhaps%20most%20notably%2C%20the%20team,Tabriz%20says), and tackling the next frontier of threats. Security is a constant, evolving challenge that requires continuous vigilance. While Chrome has contributed to improving web security standards across the ecosystem, we acknowledge that no system is perfectly secure, and our security work is never complete.

Stability: Keeping the browser and web running smoothly
-------------------------------------------------------

Chrome’s reputation for stability stems from a simple mantra: **don’t crash, and if you do, recover gracefully.** In the early days, crashes and freezes were the bane of browsing - one misbehaving script or plugin could lock up the entire browser. Chrome’s multi-process architecture was a game-changer here. By **“putting web apps and plug-ins in separate processes from the browser itself”** Chrome ensured that if a webpage’s renderer crashed, it _“won’t affect the browser or other web apps”_[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20takes%20advantage%20of,if%20an%20exploit%20does%20occur). You could kill a stuck tab via Chrome’s built-in Task Manager (another novel idea!) without needing to restart the whole application[[59]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20using%20multiple%20processes%20means,to%20restart%20the%20entire%20browser). This was a _huge_ stability win and users felt the difference immediately. I remember in 2008 people were delighted that a Flash plugin crash no longer brought down all their tabs - a common headache before. By running each tab in isolation and even giving each a sandboxed process with minimal OS privileges, Chrome not only gained security but also robust **fault isolation**[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20takes%20advantage%20of,if%20an%20exploit%20does%20occur). Other browsers followed suit in the years after (it’s table stakes now), but Chrome led the way.

We’ve spent the last 17 years refining that model. One challenge with multi-process is memory usage - more processes mean more overhead. So stability isn’t just about not crashing, but also not grinding to a halt when you have 50 tabs open. We’ve made **enormous efforts to reduce Chrome’s memory footprint** and contention. There have been many projects (often driven by user feedback like “Chrome is using too much RAM!”). For instance, in 2020-2021 we introduced “PartitionAlloc-Everywhere” a custom memory allocator tuned for Chrome, which saved memory and improved performance by reducing fragmentation. We also implemented **tab throttling and discarding**: Chrome will intelligently pause background tabs’ work and even unload tabs that haven’t been used in a while (on low memory) to free resources. Recent blog posts note that throttling background JavaScript timers and lowering tab priorities improved Core Web Vitals (like INP) and battery usage notably[[60]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,INP)[[61]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,in%20the%20last%206%20months). In Windows and Mac, Chrome now uses OS features (EcoQoS on Win, QOS on Mac) to give background tabs less CPU, making foreground tabs more responsive[[60]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,INP). These under-the-hood changes keep Chrome stable and snappy even under heavy load.

Another big stability milestone was **eliminating troublesome legacy plugins**. Flash, Java, and other NPAPI plugins were a major source of crashes and instability in browsers. Chrome initially sandboxed Flash separately to contain its crashes[[62]](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html#:~:text=Plug,with%20the%20browser%20and%20renderers), but eventually we led the charge (with others) to retire Flash entirely from the web by 2020. Each third-party component we could shed or isolate meant fewer
