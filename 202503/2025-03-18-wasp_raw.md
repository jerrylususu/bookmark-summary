How does it work? üßê
--------------------

Given a simple `.wasp` configuration file that describes the high-level details of your web app, and `.js(x)/.css/...`, source files with your unique logic, Wasp compiler generates the full source of your web app in the target stack: front-end, back-end and deployment.  
  
This unique approach is what makes Wasp "smart" and gives it its super powers!

#### Simple config language

Declaratively describe high-level details of your app.

#### Wasp CLI

All the handy commands at your fingertips.

[Learn more](https://wasp.sh/docs/general/cli)

#### React / Node.js / Prisma

You are still writing 90% of the code in your favorite technologies.

#### Goodbye boilerplate

Write only the code that matters, let Wasp handle the rest.

I normally develop in Vue.js, but in a weekend I had time to learn Wasp, React and finish a full-stack app (only missing styling). This would have been impossible before.
