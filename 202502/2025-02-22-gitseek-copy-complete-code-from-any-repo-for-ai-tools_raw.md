1

### How does GitSeek work?

GitSeek leverages advanced AI models to understand project structures and identify the most relevant code you need. You can copy these complete code segments directly into AI tools like Claude or Cursor for deeper insights and customized modifications.

2

### Is private repository supported and safe?

Yes, GitSeek fully supports private repositories with robust security measures. Your GitHub Token is encrypted during analysis and immediately deleted afterward. The downloaded repository is also promptly destroyed after processing. We only record non-repository data like usage counts, ensuring complete privacy of your code and credentials.

3

### Not getting ideal results?

If the AI output isn't meeting your expectations, try configuring a more powerful model API (such as GPT-4) for better performance. We recommend SiliconFlow Cloud [SiliconFlow Cloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/yIdS0fEe) where you can get 20M free tokens, or use any provider compatible with the OpenAI API.

4

### Is GitSeek really free?

Yes! Our free tier provides full access to core features with a basic model (5 daily extractions). You can unlock unlimited usage by configuring your own LLM API. This approach ensures you have complete control over your AI costs while enjoying GitSeek's full functionality.

5

### What extra value does Pro offer?

Pro users get significant advantages: premium AI models (GPT-4, Claude-3) for more accurate results, 500 monthly extractions without needing to configure APIs, faster response times, priority support, and API access for automation. It's perfect for teams and power users who need reliable, production-ready service.

6

### How should I use the extracted code?

GitSeek consolidates relevant files and provides a clear picture of the target project's structure. Simply copy the complete code into ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or your preferred AI tools for learning, refactoring, or directly integrating into your own projects.

7

### What is your refund policy?

We do not offer refunds for subscription payments, but you can cancel your subscription at any time and continue using the service until the end of your billing period. We recommend using our free tier before upgrading to Pro.
