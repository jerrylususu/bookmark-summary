## TL;DR
文章探讨了AI在数据驱动视觉故事讲述中的应用，通过使用Claude进行实验，评估其在创意生成、数据收集与分析、故事板与原型设计、开发与写作各阶段的表现。结果显示AI在特定任务上表现出色，但在整体项目连贯性和复杂任务处理上仍需改进，表明AI目前无法替代人类故事讲述者的精细工艺和迭代过程。未来计划将AI作为工具用于特定任务，如脚本写作和创意头脑风暴。

## Summary
1. **Introduction**
   - **AI in Spotlight**: Discussion on the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various sectors, including media and journalism.
   - **Pudding's Experiment**: Curiosity about whether AI can replicate the data-driven, visual storytelling style of The Pudding.

2. **Experiment Setup**
   - **AI Selection**: Use of Claude from Anthropic for the experiment.
   - **Process Breakdown**: Division of the story creation into four steps:
     - Idea Generation
     - Data Collection & Analysis
     - Storyboarding & Prototyping
     - Development & Writing
   - **Evaluation**: Grading the AI's work at each stage.
   - **Interaction Guidelines**: Minimal intervention and acting as a layperson to mimic real-world usage.

3. **Part 1: Idea Generation**
   - **AI Output**: Suggestions on topics like female characters in video games, fast fashion's environmental impact, and emotional content in songs.
   - **Feedback**: Preference for the emotional content in songs idea due to specificity and potential.
   - **Grade: C+**: Ideas were workable but lacked depth and specific entry points.

4. **Part 2: Data Collection & Analysis**
   - **Data Tasks**: Writing Python scripts to scrape Billboard Hot 100 song lyrics from Genius.com.
   - **Script Execution**: Rapid script writing by Claude, with human execution due to AI's inability to run code internally.
   - **Data Filtering**: Adjustments made to filter popular songs based on peak positions and weeks on chart.
   - **Error Handling**: AI corrected scripts based on error feedback.
   - **Grade: B-**: Impressive speed but with coding mistakes and lack of critical thinking.

5. **Part 3: Storyboard & Prototyping**
   - **Storyboard Creation**: AI generated a detailed outline for the story, including narrative sections and visual ideas.
   - **Visual Prototyping**: AI wrote Python code to generate charts based on the collected data.
   - **Grade: B+**: Solid outline and quick chart prototyping but lacked innovative ideas and iterative refinement.

6. **Part 4: Development & Writing**
   - **Component Development**: AI wrote Svelte components for the story, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
   - **Complex Challenges**: Struggles with more complex charts, requiring multiple attempts and guidance.
   - **Visual Content**: Description of engaging cover art and data art, with outsourcing of image generation to another AI.
   - **Grade: D**: Helpful for isolated tasks but struggled with project-wide coherence and complex tasks.

7. **Conclusion**
   - **Replaceability**: Concludes that AI, while useful, does not currently replace the craftsmanship and iterative process of human storytellers.
   - **Future Use**: Plans to use AI as a tool for specific tasks like script writing, headline generation, and idea brainstorming.
   - **Relevant Stories**: Links to other AI-related stories on The Pudding website.
