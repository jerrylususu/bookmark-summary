Title: Covers as a way of learning music and code

When you're just getting started with music, you have so many skills to learn. You have to be able to play your instrument and express yourself through it. You need to know the style you're playing, and its idioms and conventions. You may want to record your music, and need all the skills that come along with it.

Music is, mostly, subjective: there's not an objective right or wrong way to do things. And that can make it really hard! Each of these skills is then couched in this subjectivity of trying to see if it's good enough. Playing someone else's music, making a cover, is great because it can make it objective. It gives you something to check against.

When you're playing your own music, you're in charge of the entire thing. You didn't play a wrong note, because, well, you've just changed the piece! But when you play someone else's music, now there's an original and you can try to get as close to it as possible. Recreating it gives you a lot of practice in figuring out what someone did and how they did it.

It also lets you peek into _why_ they did it. Maybe a particular chord voicing is hard for you to play. Okay, let's simplify it and play an easier voicing. How does it sound now? How does it sound with the harder one? Play around with those differences and you start to see the why behind it all.

The same thing holds true for programming. One of my friends is a C++ programmer[[1]](https://ntietz.com/blog/covers-as-a-way-of-learning#fn-my-condolences) and he was telling me about how he learned C++ and data structures really well early on: He reimplemented parts of the [Boost library](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Libraries/Boost). This code makes heavy use of templates, a hard thing in C++. And it provides fundamental data structures with robust implementations and good performance[[2]](https://ntietz.com/blog/covers-as-a-way-of-learning#fn-maybe-better).

What he would do is look at the library and pick a slice of it to implement. He'd look at what the API for it is, how it was implemented, what it was doing under the hood. Then he'd go ahead and try to do it himself, without any copy-pasting and without real-time copying from the other screen.

Sometimes, he'd run into things which didn't make sense. Why is this a doubly-linked list here, when it seems a singly-linked list would do just fine? And in those moments, if you can't find a reason? You get to go down that path, make it the singly-linked version, and then find out later: oh, ohhh. Ohhhh, they did that for a reason.

It lets you run into some of the hard problems, grapple with them, and understand why the original was written how it was. You get to study with some really strong programmers, by proxy via their codebase. Their code is your tutor and your guide for understanding how to write similar things in the future.

There's a lot of judgment out there about doing original works. This kind of judgment of covers and of reimplementing things that already exist, just to learn. So many people have internalized this, and I've heard countless times "I want to make a new project, but everything I think of, someone else has already done!"

And to that, I say: do it anyway[[3]](https://ntietz.com/blog/covers-as-a-way-of-learning#fn-credit). If someone else has done it, that's great. That means that you had an idea so good that someone else thought it was a good idea, too. And that means that, because someone else has done it, you have a reference now. You can compare notes, and you can see how they did it, and you can learn.

1.   I'm a recovering C++ programmer myself, and had some unpleasant experiences associated with the language. This friend is a game developer, and his industry is one where C++ makes a lot of sense to use because of the built-up code around it.

2.   He said they're not perfect, but that they're really good and solid and you know a lot of people thought for a long time about how to do them. You get to follow in their footsteps and benefit from all that hard thinking time. [↩](https://ntietz.com/blog/covers-as-a-way-of-learning#fr-maybe-better-1)

3.   But: you must always give credit when you are using someone else's work. If you're reimplementing someone else's library, or covering someone's song, don't claim it's your own original invention. [↩](https://ntietz.com/blog/covers-as-a-way-of-learning#fr-credit-1)
