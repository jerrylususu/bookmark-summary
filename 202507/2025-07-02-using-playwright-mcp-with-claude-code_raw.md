Title: Using Playwright MCP with Claude Code

Inspired [by Armin](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/29/agentic-coding/), I decided to figure out how to use the official [microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) Playwright MCP server with Claude Code.

Short version: run this before starting `claude`:

claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'

That's it! Now when you run `claude` Playwright will be available. You can say things like:

> `Use playwright mcp to open a browser to example.com`

And a visible Chrome browser window, controlled by Claude Code, will open in front of you.

I found I needed to explicitly say "playwright mcp" the first time, otherwise it might try to use Bash to run Playwright instead.

The `claude mcp add` command will persist but will only affect the directory in which you run it.

It took me a while to figure out how that works - eventually I tracked it down to a JSON file `~/.claude.json` which includes a `"projects"` key with objects for each directory I had used with Claude Code in the past. That object includes MCPs and allowed commands as well.

Since Claude uses a visible browser window when interacting with Playwright, authentication is easy: have it show you a login page, then login yourself with your own credentials and tell it what to do next. Cookies will persist for the duration of the session.

With the MCP loaded you can run `/mcp` and then navigate to `playwright` to view all available tools. Here's the full list:

1.   `browser_close` (read-only)
2.   `browser_resize` (read-only)
3.   `browser_console_messages` (read-only)
4.   `browser_handle_dialog`
5.   `browser_file_upload`
6.   `browser_install`
7.   `browser_press_key`
8.   `browser_navigate`
9.   `browser_navigate_back` (read-only)
10.   `browser_navigate_forward` (read-only)
11.   `browser_network_requests` (read-only)
12.   `browser_pdf_save` (read-only)
13.   `browser_take_screenshot` (read-only)
14.   `browser_snapshot` (read-only)
15.   `browser_click`
16.   `browser_drag`
17.   `browser_hover` (read-only)
18.   `browser_type`
19.   `browser_select_option`
20.   `browser_tab_list` (read-only)
21.   `browser_tab_new` (read-only)
22.   `browser_tab_select` (read-only)
23.   `browser_tab_close`
24.   `browser_generate_playwright_test` (read-only)
25.   `browser_wait_for` (read-only)

You don't have to reference these by name, Claude should usually be smart enough to pick the right one for the task at hand.
