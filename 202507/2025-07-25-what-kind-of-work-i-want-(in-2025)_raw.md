In 2021, I wrote [this post](https://www.seangoedecke.com/my-engineering-values) describing the kind of work I wanted then. Almost five years later, it’s time for an update.

### What kind of work do I want?

**I want to work remote.** I’m happy to do quarterly in-person offsites or similar, but I’m not interested in a formal hybrid working environment. I put a high value on not having to commute and on being able to work in a style that suits me. I enjoy living where I do in Australia and am not willing to relocate.

**I want to work on something central to the company.** I am more comfortable in a medium or high-pressure environment than in a low-pressure one.

**I’m happy to build on top of legacy systems** - in fact, getting stuff done in monolithic codebases is my specialty - as long as I’m working on something that’s top-of-mind for company leadership. I prefer iterating fast on an 80% solution than spending a lot of time to slowly polish a 100% solution.

**I do not care about doing greenfield work** or building the most interesting part of the product. I will happily build a billing or permissions system if that’s what needs doing.

As an Australian software engineer, **I prefer working for American tech companies** because I want to work on large systems that people have heard of. That doesn’t mean I want to exclusively work for American companies - there are some Australian companies that are well-known enough that I would also happily work there - but it would be a hard sell to get me into a startup.

Right now, **I am very interested in AI**, both as a tool for software engineering and as a transformative technology in general. I’m currently working on AI products at GitHub, but a seriously innovative AI product at some other company would be a compelling draw.

I do not want to work on systems I consider obviously unethical. **No proof-of-work blockchain, no online gambling, no autonomous weapons of war.**

I value a healthy company culture. That means **a diverse culture with different kinds of people and different perspectives**. A monoculture can be productive, but it’s brittle: an external shock can cause it to turn toxic very quickly.

I want **a low-process management style that trusts me to do my job**. I have worked in environments with many hours of scrum meetings per-week, and environments with no formal scrum meetings at all, and productivity was about the same. A company that takes Agile software development very seriously is unlikely to be a good fit for me.

### What’s changed since 2021?

Recruiters can probably stop reading here. But I want to reflect a bit about what’s changed since the last time I wrote this kind of post. In 2021, I wrote that I’m looking for:

> A job where reliability and performance is important, at scale. Ideally remote. No tiny startups. No gambling, predatory fintech, or blockchain. I value D&I, emotionally healthy teams, and good management.

What’s changed, almost five years later? A lot has happened since 2021.

*   Overall, the balance of power in tech [has shifted](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over) away from engineers and towards tech companies.
*   I personally went to work for GitHub, where (among other things) I spent two years working on Copilot as it grew from a few tens of millions to over $300M ARR[1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/my-engineering-values-2025/#fn-1).
*   I went through the staff engineer promotion process [for a second time](https://www.seangoedecke.com/staff-engineer-promotions).
*   Finally, this [blog](https://www.seangoedecke.com/on-writing) really took off, after [this post](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship) - thanks to that, I’ve now been on [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&t=1s&pp=ygUNc2VhbiBnb2VkZWNrZQ%3D%3D) and even Australian national [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyb3jA0ZOM&pp=ygUNc2VhbiBnb2VkZWNrZQ%3D%3D)

The biggest change in my engineering values is that **I no longer want to work in a pure maintenance role on existing legacy systems**. I still love that kind of work, but in 2025 it’s just not sensible to try and position yourself like that. Legacy systems - even ones beloved by users - are never tech companies’ top priority. They’re always going to be fertile ground for layoffs and cutbacks. In the 2010s, you could carve out a really good career optimizing and lovingly maintaining this stuff. Now you can’t. Instead, I want to work on projects that are top-of-mind for company leadership. Put me under [the spotlight](https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-spotlight)!

I still feel mostly the same about organizations. I think D&I is a competitive strength, and that low-process is usually better than high-process. I still don’t want to work for proof-of-work blockchain (although there are many fewer jobs there than there were in 2021!) or gambling tech. It’s worth noting that the current evil technology _du jour_ - large language models - is not something I have decisive moral objections about, and I currently do work on AI products. See [here](https://www.seangoedecke.com/is-ai-wrong) for more thoughts on that.

My view on what I want from a manager has changed as well. My 2021 post listed a bunch of things I want out of a manager - to be an active participant in my career progression, to help me develop new skills, and so on. In 2025, I really just want a manager who’s good at their job (i.e. able to get stuff done in the org) and who’s willing to tell me the truth once they realize I can be trusted. Either way, that’s not something that recruiters are going to be able to help with, so it’s much less prominent in this version of the post.

### Final thoughts

Overall I’m struck by how similar my 2021 and 2025 statements of values are. I feel as though I’ve changed a lot as an engineer in four (almost five) years, but my general values have only changed in minor ways: I’m more comfortable with low-process environments, I’m happy to not work on performance and reliability stuff, and I have different expectations of my manager.

Part of this is just that engineers don’t have as many options in 2025. If we were still in the zero-interest-rates era, maybe I would have increasingly baroque conditions about what job I’m willing to accept. Right now, I just want to be doing interesting work that the company cares about.

1.   That was a very informative (and formative) experience. I’d love to write about it in another five years.
