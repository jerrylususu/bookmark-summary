What if you could search every visible word on New York City’s streets?

This is possible because media artist [Yufeng Zhao](https://www.yufengzhao.com/) fed millions of publicly-available panoramas from Google Street View into a computer program that transcribes text within the images (_anyone_ can access these Street View images; you don’t even need a Google account!).

The result is a [search engine](https://www.alltext.nyc/) of much of what’s written in NYC’s streets. It's limited to what a Google Street View car can capture, so it excludes text in areas such as alleyways and parks, or any writing too small to be read by a moving vehicle.

The scale of the data is immense: over 8 million Google Street View images (from the past 18 years) and 138 million identified snippets of text.

So we can make frivolous things like this:

♬♫♩♪ New York...concrete jungle where dreams are made of...

‘Empire State of Mind’ by Alicia Keys &Jay-Z

The data is astonishing; it feels like sifting through the city's source code. For example, here's all 111,290 matches for “pizza,” on a map.

Let's look at some other maps.

#### The Geography of NYC Text

Broadway 62,424 matches

Matches for “Broadway” identify street signs, of course. The resulting map is oddly satisfying, illuminating each of the five boroughs’ Broadway.[View Images of “Broadway”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Broadway)

![Image 3: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Broadway”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/broadway.jpg)

Zooming into Times Square, “Broadway” expands to depict Broadway theaters.

Luxury 16,731 matches

Every new residential building calls itself “luxury,” but only Hudson Yards has applied the label to an entire neighborhood.[View Images of “Luxury”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Luxury)

![Image 5: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Luxury”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/luxury.jpg)

Beware 10,419 matches

There's a simple answer to why “beware” has such a clear geographic footprint, oddly completely absent from Manhattan. At the end of this article, we’ll show you why that is (or ask for a hint).[View Images of “Beware”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Beware)

![Image 6: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Beware”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/beware.jpg)

Gold 51,353 matches

The map of “gold” depicts Manhattan’s Diamond District, as well as streets lined with “we buy gold” jewelry and pawn shops.[View Images of “Gold”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Gold)

![Image 7: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Gold”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/gold.jpg)

Iglesia 16,967 matches

Some of the more interesting maps depict cultural enclaves. Coordinates for “iglesia” (church, in Spanish) point to Spanish-speaking communities.[View Images of “Iglesia”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Iglesia)

![Image 8: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Iglesia”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/iglesia.jpg)

Jerk 4,900 matches

Similarly, “jerk” (the cooking style, not the personality) points to Jamaican enclaves in Flatbush, Brooklyn and Jamaica (the neighborhood), Queens.[View Images of “Jerk”](https://www.alltext.nyc/search?q=Jerk)

![Image 9: Map of NYC showing the location of text that appears in Google Street View matching the phrase “Jerk”](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/street-view/assets/images/jerk.jpg)

???32,825 matches

See if you can guess this one, based on the geography: this adjective denotes that it’s not just a barbershop and not just a salon.

A quick image search shows how these words appear on NYC streets. First, here’s a cliché Brooklyn phrase, which actually appears on signs as you exit the borough.

Fuhgeddaboudit

Street signs have all kinds of rules and restrictions, including a common prohibition on “ball playing” in front of apartment buildings (is this the reason the Knicks haven’t won the championship in 50 years?).

Editor’s note: If you think this kind of tyranny is disgusting, please join me in the “Ball is Life” caucus to help bring ball playing back to the streets of New York.

We were able to capture most graffiti text (and tags!)—anything visible from the street.

While these searches are seemingly benign, they all rely on the surreal nature of the data: 8 million images spanning nearly two decades, indefinitely preserved in the Google Street View digital record.

This includes text that was temporary, but memorialized in Street View (these images are from 2020-2023).
