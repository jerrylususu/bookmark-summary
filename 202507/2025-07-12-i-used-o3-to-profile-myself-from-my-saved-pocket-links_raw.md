Welp, Pocket [shuts down tomorrow](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket) despite our [pleas](https://saeedesmaili.com/posts/my-content-consumption-workflow/#:~:text=please%20Mozilla%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20kill%20it) for it to stay. While migrating[1](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fn:1) all of my saved articles, I noticed that I‚Äôve got almost 900 saved articles spanning nearly 7 years. That‚Äôs a goldmine of stuff-I-like data! Some quick analysis using xsv[2](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fn:2):

```
ùÑ¢ unzip pocket.zip && xsv headers part_000000.csv
1   title
2   url
3   time_added
4   tags
5   status

ùÑ¢ xsv sample 1 part_000000.csv | xsv flatten

ùÑ¢ xsv select time_added part_000000.csv |
    xsv stats | xsv select min,max | xsv flatten |
    while read header value; do
        echo -n "$header "
        date -I -d "@$value"
    done

### Experiment

Recalling Simon Willison‚Äôs recent [geoguessing challenge](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/) for o3, I considered, ‚ÄúWhat might o3 be able to tell me about myself, simply based on a list of URLs I‚Äôve chosen to save?‚Äù I opened a temporary chat with o3 (doesn‚Äôt use ChatGPT‚Äôs memory feature) and prompted:

> I‚Äôm going to share a list of articles that I‚Äôve saved to Pocket, a read-it-later app. I want you to use that information to ‚Äúprofile‚Äù me. Tell me everything about myself that you can possibly infer from this data set. Here‚Äôs an example of possible dimensions of that profile, but feel free to include other things that you can infer: age, sex, geographic location, education level, industry/field of work, job level/seniority, income bracket, political orientation, risk tolerance, learning style, information diet, relationship status, parental status and kids‚Äô ages, health concerns, major life transitions, seasonal patterns in interests, etc.

### Results

o3‚Äôs response in full[3](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fn:3):

> Thought for 13 seconds
> 
> 
> *   The user has shared a broad range of article preferences, which could actually give me some good insight into their demographic and interests. Technical articles related to software, AI, cybersecurity, and finance suggest strong analytical and professional interests. The content about family life, homeschooling, and Catholic practices points to someone who‚Äôs likely a parent, possibly with a strong focus on family values. It makes sense to assume they might be male, based on the profiles aggregating to this, but I‚Äôm not completely sure yet. I‚Äôll keep this in mind!
> *   I‚Äôm pulling together some details! The user‚Äôs mix of technical articles and Catholic family topics suggests they could either be a father interested in homemaking or a female parent with a tech background. Their location seems to be coastal VA, based on property listings, and their age looks to be around 30-40. With a career in software engineering, likely at a senior level, their income probably exceeds 150k. They seem to have a self-directed learning style and a moderate to high risk tolerance in investments. They‚Äôre likely married with multiple young kids.

### Reaction

Yeah, pretty accurate. Perhaps even eerily so. Upon first reading, I was surprised when it nailed age range, location, family size, etc.‚Äîdetails that I didn‚Äôt expect to be represented in a data set that I thought mostly consisted of Hacker News posts. Shows you how much can be inferred by a simple trail of ‚Äúlikes.‚Äù

Worth noting that o3 tended to perform better (i.e., the response felt more accurate) when I copypasted the CSV data directly into the prompt body. Sending the CSV as a file attachment caused o3 to get too fixated on using Python to sample and analyze the CSV data rather than simply ‚Äútaking it all in,‚Äù and in my experience yielded a less compelling narrative at the end.

### Implications

Is there a lesson here? We already know that advertising companies profile us based on expressed interests, but up until recently it felt like only Google or Facebook had access to analysis capabilities strong enough to draw meaningful conclusions from disparate data points. I‚Äôd agree with Simon that the more interesting takeaway is ‚Äúthe fact that this technology is openly available to almost anyone.‚Äù

Case in point: I‚Äôll be using this profile to power a [personal content recommendation system](https://saeedesmaili.com/posts/building-a-personal-content-recommendation-system-data-processing-and-cleaning/).

1.   I‚Äôve moved over to [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/), and also took the opportunity to switch from Inoreader to [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html). Happy with both. Self-hosting these services is much easier now in 2025 compared to my last self-hosting initiative years ago; [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) has been a huge part of that.[‚Ü©Ô∏é](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fnref:1)

2.   [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) has been hands-down my favorite way to quickly explore CSV data. Looks like it‚Äôs no longer maintained as of 2 months ago, but it feels pretty feature-complete.[‚Ü©Ô∏é](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fnref:2)

3.   I mean, mostly intact. Did you really expect me to leave in the part about ‚Äúdandruff remedies‚Äù?[‚Ü©Ô∏é](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/#fnref:3)
