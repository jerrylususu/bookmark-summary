**[Core Web Vitals](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals) measure user experience by assessing a website’s performance. This write-up is a history of how Core Web Vitals came to be based on my recollections from our work on it at Google from 2014 onwards. The initiative saved Chrome users over [30,000 years](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html) waiting with [businesses](https://web.dev/case-studies/vitals-business-impact#:~:text=in%20your%20browser.-,Why%20Core%20Web%20Vitals%20matter%20to%20your%20users%20and%20business,into%20loyal%20and%20returning%20customers.) seeing revenue and user-engagement lifts through optimizing for it, inclusive of 2025.**

Looking back at 2023, 2024 and 2025
-----------------------------------

Let’s start by reviewing the incredible progress we’ve all made together.

In 2023, the collective effort to optimize Chrome and websites across the ecosystem saved users a staggering 12,000 years of time, as measured by Core Web Vitals. Thanks to Annie Sullivan for her analysis showing this.

The momentum grew significantly in 2024, with that figure nearly tripling to an estimated 30,000 years saved. This massive impact translates directly into a better, faster, and more responsive web experience for millions of users around the globe every day.

2025 isn’t over yet, but as of September, the [state](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report/c/XeBW0zNQZbs) of Core Web Vitals (data from [CrUX](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/)) shows 53% of origins had good LCP, CLS and INP. Now let’s dive into the history behind Core Web Vitals to see how we got here.

Origins and motivation: from AMP to open web metrics
----------------------------------------------------

For years, Google emphasized speed and user experience as core principles of the web. Google’s Chrome team often repeated that “speed has been one of Chrome’s core principles since the beginning” yet many sites still delivered sluggish experiences[[1]](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html#:~:text=Speed%20has%20been%20one%20of,rewarding%20sites%20delivering%20fast%20experiences).

In 2010, Google Search began using site speed [[2]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking) as a lightweight ranking signal on desktop, reflecting an early view that faster pages create better outcomes for users and businesses alike. The signal was intentionally modest, but it put performance on the map for SEO. Still, there were many aspects of web experiences that were slow, sluggish and didn’t provide an optimal user experience.

Around 2015, Google’s **AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)** project was introduced to tackle this by creating stripped-down, cached versions of pages for fast loading [[3]](https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages/). AMP could indeed make pages load faster, but it came with trade-offs: it was a walled garden of optimized HTML/CSS and served from Google’s cache, raising concerns about openness and flexibility. By the late 2010s, it became clear that **a more standardized, open approach** was needed - one that any site could adopt without special frameworks, and that could be recognized and even rewarded by platforms like Google Search.

In 2018, the performance stance broadened with the **Speed Update**, which applied page speed to mobile search rankings while reiterating that relevance still dominates [[4]](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/search-ads-speed). Together these steps made clear that performance wasn’t an afterthought in Search - it was part of page quality. Ads moved in parallel. Google Ads introduced a mobile landing page speed score and factored mobile speed into ad systems, reinforcing that faster experiences convert better and should be rewarded. In other words, even outside of ranking blue links, Google’s ecosystem was already aligning incentives around real-world speed and user satisfaction.

Google’s desire to move away from the AMP-only approach culminated in an initiative to define **open web performance metrics** that could apply to any page. Internally, teams from Chrome and Search partnered to tackle this. They recognized that even if Google Search itself was fast, “the user experience would be subpar if the pages found were slow to load”[[5]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=services%20efficiently%20and%20rapidly,found%20were%20slow%20to%20load). By examining millions of pages, they set out to **define a public standard for a fast, user-friendly web page**[[6]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=Defining%20the%20Fast%20Web). These efforts led to the idea of **“Core Web Vitals”** – a set of unified, user-centric metrics that could gauge key aspects of page experience for any website. The goal was to have metrics that are **field-measurable** (i.e. reflect real users’ experiences) and that correlate with outcomes like user engagement. In short, Google wanted to empower the _open web_ with the same performance focus that AMP had, but **without requiring a special framework**, and to reward sites that deliver great user experiences in an open-standard way. Core Web Vitals would build on years of work (including [progressive metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvZ7-Uh0R4Q)) thinking about the web’s performance challenges, but with a fresh focus on **user-centric, real-world metrics** that anyone could measure and improve.

Defining Core Web Vitals: three pillars of user experience
----------------------------------------------------------

In **May 2020**, Google officially launched the **Web Vitals** initiative. This was announced on the Chromium Blog as “a new program… to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web.”[[7]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=consistency%20challenges%20for%20many) The first and most important of these were the **Core Web Vitals** – a shortlist of metrics focused on the _core_ aspects of user experience that apply to all web pages[[8]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=Measuring%20the%20quality%20of%20user,the%202020%20Core%20Web%20Vitals). In 2020, the Core Web Vitals consisted of **three metrics**, each capturing a critical dimension of performance:

*   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** – a loading speed metric marking the point when the main content of the page has likely appeared. LCP identifies when the largest content element in the viewport (such as a hero image or headline text) is rendered, effectively measuring perceived load completion[[9]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=,shift%20of%20visible%20page%20content). This was groundbreaking because it moved beyond earlier metrics like First Contentful Paint or onload, and focused on when the _user actually sees_ meaningful content[[10]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=We%20examined%20millions%20of%20pages,discuss%20in%20this%20blog%20post).

*   **First Input Delay (FID)** – an interactivity responsiveness metric that quantifies the delay between the user’s first interaction (e.g. a click or tap) and the browser’s response. FID captures the **input lag** experienced by users on first interaction, reflecting whether the page is readily interactive or bogged down by heavy scripts loading[[11]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=the%20point%20in%20the%20page,shift%20of%20visible%20page%20content).

*   **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** – a visual stability metric measuring how much the page’s layout moves around during load. It sums up the unexpected layout shifts that occur (with a focus on _severity_ and _frequency_), so pages that cause elements to jump around (e.g. images without dimensions pushing text, or ads dynamically inserting) get a higher CLS score[[12]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=,shift%20of%20visible%20page%20content). A low CLS means a more stable, pleasant viewing experience without the annoying “page jank” that can cause mis-clicks.

These metrics were chosen based on extensive research and experimentation we did on the team. Google’s user experience researchers and engineers (like interaction designer **Amar Sagoo**, engineer **Annie Sullivan**, and product manager **Vivek Sekhar**) dove into human - computer interaction studies to find the correlations between objective performance numbers and user perceptions[[13]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=Web%20Vitals%20is%20an%20initiative,paper%20and%20finding%20the%20answer)[[14]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=Interruptions%20due%20to%20waiting). They published _“The Science Behind Web Vitals”_ in May 2020, explaining the rationale. For example, they noted that there isn’t one magic cutoff for “fast enough,” but multiple studies suggested keeping load times under about **2–3 seconds** is critical to avoid user frustration[[15]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=So%20instead%20of%20looking%20for,For%20example)[[16]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=The%20Largest%20Contentful%20Paint%20,Core%20Web%20Vitals%20metric%20thresholds). Likewise, responses to user input should ideally happen within **100 ms** to feel instantaneous and preserve the illusion of direct manipulation[[17]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=,19)[[18]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=realise%20that%20they%E2%80%99re%20now%20buying,two%20items).

Similarly, any **layout shift** should be minimal; even a 0.25 CLS (where content moves noticeably) can degrade user experience, so the goal was set much lower. The Chrome team analyzed real user data to choose **practical threshold targets** for each metric that correlate with significantly better outcomes while still being attainable by a substantial slice of sites[[19]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=The%20Largest%20Contentful%20Paint%20,Core%20Web%20Vitals%20metric%20thresholds). They recommended that sites aim for **LCP under 2.5 s**, **FID under 100 ms**, and **CLS below 0.1** (measured at the 75th percentile of page loads)[[20]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=realise%20that%20they%E2%80%99re%20now%20buying,two%20items)[[21]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=The%20responsiveness%20related%20to%20these,of%20page%20loads). Hitting these “good” thresholds has a tangible impact: studies showed that pages meeting all the Core Web Vitals thresholds saw users **24% less likely to abandon** the page mid-load, compared to pages that did not meet the thresholds[[22]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#:~:text=Impact). In other words, if you can keep your load fast, your layout stable, and your input responsive, users are far more likely to stay engaged – a compelling argument for these metrics.

Crucially, Google made sure these metrics were **standardized and open**. Draft web specifications were published (e.g. for LCP, CLS, and a draft Event Timing API for FID) via the WICG and web perf standards groups[[23]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=We%20strongly%20encourage%20all%20site,each%20of%20the%20Core%20Web). Chrome (and other browsers) implemented these metrics in their engines, meaning any developer or analytics provider could measure them using the PerformanceObserver API.

To jump-start adoption, Google also released an **open-source web-vitals JavaScript library** in May 2020 that developers could drop into their sites to measure LCP, FID, and CLS for their real users[[24]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=specifications%3A%20Largest%20Contentful%20Paint%2C%20Layout,Vitals%20for%20your%20site%E2%80%99s%20users). This library, authored by Googlers like **Phillip Walton**, handles the nuances of capturing the metrics accurately and even accounts for things like page backgrounding. It made it trivial for developers to send these metrics to Google Analytics or any other analytics backend for their own monitoring. At the same time, I built a **Core Web Vitals extension** for Chrome that would display the LCP, FID, and CLS in real-time as you browse a page[[25]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=In%20our%20testing%20and%20development,the%20current%20URL%20and%20origin) – useful for developers doing spot-checks in the browser. All of this reflected a broad effort to make these new metrics accessible and useful to everyone in the ecosystem, not just inside Google.

Page Experience: Core Web Vitals in Google Search rankings
----------------------------------------------------------

Google’s Search team quickly embraced Core Web Vitals as part of a broader “**Page Experience**” update. On May 28, 2020, Google Search Central announced upcoming changes to include these metrics in ranking algorithms[[26]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=as%20factors%20for%20ranking%20results,user%20experience%20on%20the%20web). The rationale was straightforward: _if two pages have similar content relevance, why not rank the one that offers a better user experience higher?_ The **Page Experience signal** would combine Core Web Vitals with other existing UX-related signals (mobile-friendliness, HTTPS security, and avoidance of intrusive interstitials) to create a more holistic ranking factor[[27]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=We%27re%20combining%20the%20signals%20derived,experience%20that%20we%20can%20measure). Importantly, Google made clear that great content still trumps all – page experience is one of many factors, and **a fast site won’t outrank a more relevant site just because of speed**. But in cases of ties or close calls, having good Web Vitals could be the tiebreaker[[28]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=While%20all%20of%20the%20components,important%20for%20visibility%20in%20Search)[[29]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=experience%20are%20subpar,important%20for%20visibility%20in%20Search).

Perhaps the most headline-grabbing part of this announcement was that once the page experience update went live, **the Top Stories carousel on mobile would no longer be restricted to AMP pages**[[30]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20this%20update%2C,owners%20optimize%20their%20page%20experience)[[31]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=the%20AMP%20requirement%20from%20Top,owners%20optimize%20their%20page%20experience). Previously, Google News/Top Stories on mobile required AMP to be eligible; this requirement was to be lifted, making any page (AMP or not) with good page experience eligible. In other words, **AMP was no longer the only path to great mobile SEO** – an open web page that meets the Core Web Vitals and other page experience criteria could also be featured. Google explicitly stated: “AMP will no longer be necessary for stories to be featured in Top Stories on mobile; it will be open to any page”[[32]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=When%20we%20roll%20out%20the,what%27s%20linked%20from%20Top%20Stories). This was a pivotal shift, signaling Google’s confidence in these new metrics as a proxy for a good user experience, and its desire to encourage all sites to improve rather than funnel them into an AMP framework.

Google gave the ecosystem ample notice. Recognizing that 2020 was a tumultuous year (with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting many businesses’ priorities), they announced that the ranking change would **not take effect until 2021**, and promised at least 6 months’ warning[[33]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=A%20note%20on%20timing%3A%20We,immediate%20need%20to%20take%20action). True to that promise, in November 2020 they provided an update that the Page Experience ranking change would roll out starting in **May 2021**. Ultimately, the **Page Experience Update** began rolling out in mid-June 2021 and was fully live by the end of August 2021 (for mobile search)[[34]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=Updates). A similar update for desktop search followed in February–March 2022.

When the update landed, Google’s ranking algorithm started using Core Web Vitals as one of its hundreds of signals. Pages that met the “good” thresholds for all three CWV metrics were considered as having a **good page experience**. Google also created a **Page Experience report** in Google Search Console to help site owners see what percentage of their pages were passing the thresholds, using data from the Chrome UX Report (more on CrUX shortly)[[35]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=For%20some%20developers%2C%20understanding%20how,Web%20Vitals%20into%20their%20offerings). This way, webmasters and SEOs had direct feedback on how their site was faring in the eyes of the page experience signals.

It’s worth noting that Google flirted with the idea of **surfacing a “badge” in search results** for pages with good page experience (just as Chrome had considered badges in the browser UI). In the end, no permanent badge icon was added to Google’s search snippets – the reward mostly came in the form of ranking boosts rather than explicit labels. However, for a period Google did show a temporary “Page Experience” indicator in Search Console and even in search results experiments. The key takeaway was: Google was publicly incentivizing performance and UX. Achieving good Core Web Vitals would not only delight users but _could also improve a page’s visibility in search_. Google’s own documentation states that while the direct SEO ranking boost was relatively modest, **“it is highly recommended for site owners to achieve good Core Web Vitals for success with Search”**[[36]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=that%20we%20will%20discuss%20in,this%20blog%20post) – because it aligns with creating a better user experience which in turn correlates with users engaging more and bouncing less.

Tooling and Data: Chrome UX Report and performance measurement
--------------------------------------------------------------

To support this ecosystem shift, Google invested heavily in tooling and data for Web Vitals. A cornerstone of this effort is the **Chrome UX Report (CrUX)** – a public dataset of real-user experience metrics. In fact, CrUX had been around since 2017, collecting anonymized performance data from millions of Chrome users for millions of sites. When Core Web Vitals arrived, CrUX immediately started reporting LCP, FID, and CLS for all origin URLs in its dataset[[37]](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html#:~:text=Chrome%20UX%20Report%20enables%20site,and%20easy%20%E2%80%94%20stay%20tuned). This made it possible for anyone to query field performance data. Google provided access via BigQuery and later via a **CrUX API** and **CrUX Dashboard**, so developers and SEOs could easily check how their site (or competitors) were doing on CWV metrics in the field. They even introduced a **CrUX History API** to obtain a time series of these metrics, enabling tracking progress over months[[38]](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/history-api#:~:text=The%20CrUX%20History%20API%20gives,at%20page%20and%20origin%20granularity)[[39]](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report/c/HfZnF5Xaf74#:~:text=,the%20daily%20API%2C%20the).

On the developer tooling side, the integration was swift. By late 2020, most of Google’s performance tools had been updated to highlight Core Web Vitals. **Lighthouse**, the open-source auditing tool (used in Chrome DevTools and PageSpeed Insights), incorporated diagnostics and scoring around CWV. For example, Lighthouse added audits to flag “Largest Contentful Paint was X seconds (target <2.5s)” and suggestions to improve it, etc. **Chrome DevTools** added a Core Web Vitals pane and timeline markers so you could see LCP elements or layout shifts during page load. **PageSpeed Insights (PSI)**, which traditionally gave lab scores, was overhauled to focus on CWV – it now prominently shows field data for LCP, FID (later INP), and CLS at the top, taken from CrUX[[40]](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20performance%2C%20check%3A)[[41]](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html#:~:text=,performance%20and%20other%20best%20practices). Google Search Console, as mentioned, got a dedicated Core Web Vitals report that groups pages into “good”, “needs improvement”, “poor” buckets for each metric, helping site owners pinpoint trouble spots[[35]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#:~:text=For%20some%20developers%2C%20understanding%20how,Web%20Vitals%20into%20their%20offerings). In short, a whole suite of tools was aligned to **measure, monitor, and debug** these new metrics. Much of the tooling work here was driven by Elizabeth Sweeny, Paul Irish, myself and others.

The web development community also rallied with third-party tools. Real User Monitoring (RUM) service providers quickly integrated Core Web Vitals into their offerings. For instance, Akamai’s mPulse added support for LCP, FID, CLS as first-class metrics right out of the box[[42]](https://www.akamai.com/blog/performance/measuring-improving-core-web-vitals#:~:text=Akamai%20Blog%20,to%20get%20ahead%20of); New Relic’s Browser agent and others like Dynatrace, Datadog, and SpeedCurve all did the same, so that companies could track these metrics on their real traffic. Even Cloudflare (which operates at the network edge) introduced a Browser Insights service that could collect Web Vitals by injecting a script[[43]](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-rum-diaries-enabling-web-analytics-by-default/#:~:text=The%20RUM%20Diaries%3A%20enabling%20Web,plus%20data%20about%20resource). The existence of the web-vitals JS library made it straightforward for any analytics tool to grab these metrics – some tools directly incorporated that library, while others wrote their own measurement code using the PerformanceObserver APIs. The result was that by 2021, **Core Web Vitals became ubiquitous in the dashboards of web performance monitoring tools**. This widespread availability helped spread awareness and gave developers the data to drive performance improvements.

The **Chrome User Experience Report** data was also vital for tracking progress of the web as a whole. Throughout 2021 and 2022, the percentage of traffic with “good” CWV steadily climbed, and this was often reported in the HTTP Archive’s annual _Web Almanac_ or Google’s own blog updates. We’ll dive into the improvements shortly, but it’s clear that having measurable metrics that are publicly visible created a kind of virtuous competition – site owners and platform providers started bragging about their Core Web Vitals and striving to improve them, knowing both users and Google cared about these numbers.

Impact and Improvements: Making the Web Faster and more stable
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once Core Web Vitals were established, it triggered a massive, multi-pronged effort across the web ecosystem to improve these metrics. Google Chrome’s own engineering team took a hard look at the browser, finding ways to optimize how Chrome loads and renders web pages. Even small improvements at the browser level could benefit the entire web, given Chrome’s huge user base. Some key optimizations launched in Chrome over 2020–2023 include:

*   **Prioritizing Content for LCP:** Chrome made changes to prioritize loading of critical content. For example, Chrome enhanced how it discovers and loads images: it now identifies the first few images in the HTML (which often include the LCP image) and gives them higher network priority[[44]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=Image)[[45]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=Caption%3A%20An%20example%20of%20Chrome%E2%80%99s,5s). An internal experiment showed that prioritizing the first 5 images this way improved LCP on some pages from 3.1 s to 2.5 s, a significant win[[44]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=Image). Similarly, new web standards like the fetchpriority attribute (a “Priority Hints” mechanism) were introduced, allowing developers to mark an image or iframe as high priority for LCP. Chrome implemented these hints to boost the loading of crucial resources.

*   **Back/Forward Cache (BFCache):** Chrome historically did not fully BFCache pages (a cache that allows instant back/forward navigation) due to technical complexities, but in recent years they enabled BFCache for many pages. By 2023, Chrome achieved a **notable BFCache hit rate increase** on both desktop and Android, meaning users going “back” to a page would see it instantly (zero LCP, zero input delay, since the page never unloads)[[46]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20proud%20to%20highlight%20numerous,ways%20we%E2%80%99ve%20optimized%20performance)[[47]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,and%20Desktop%20%281.8). Large platforms like Amazon reported benefiting from Chrome’s BFCache: Amazon saw a **22.7 percentage point increase** in back/forward cache usage after Chrome’s improvements (from version M112)[[48][49]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=Major%20web%20platforms%20have%20also,40%20pp%20improvement). This translates to a smoother UX and effectively perfect CWV metrics for those navigations.

*   **Prerendering (NoState Prefetch / Prerender2):** Chrome launched a new prerenderer (called “Prerender2”) that allows the browser to fully load and render a page in the background, then instantly swap it in when the user navigates. Initially used for Google Search (prerendering the top result) and for typed URL predictions, this can cut LCP dramatically. In fact, Chrome reported that **omnibox search prerendering** yields a **500–700 ms (≈15–25%) median LCP improvement** on those navigations[[50]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=LCP%20by%20,user%20engagement%20and%20ecosystem%20health). Chrome is carefully rolling this out (to avoid mis-predictions or privacy issues), but it represents a step toward that ideal of “instant” page loads.

*   **Optimizing Network and Scheduling:** The Chrome team identified various small delays in input responsiveness and tackled them. For instance, they introduced a feature to **Preconnect on pointer-down** (when you start a tap/click, before you release) which shaves a few milliseconds off the connection setup for link navigations[[51]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,user%20engagement%20and%20ecosystem%20health). That yielded ~6–10 ms faster LCP on cross-origin navigations on average – seemingly tiny, but every improvement counts at scale[[51]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,user%20engagement%20and%20ecosystem%20health). They also improved how the browser’s main thread handles tasks when multiple tabs are open, to reduce contention. By adjusting task scheduling and using mechanisms like Windows 11’s EcoQOS for background tabs, Chrome was able to improve **Interaction to Next Paint (INP) by ~5% and LCP by ~2%** in heavily loaded scenarios[[52]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,INP). These are incremental gains that add up across billions of page views.

*   **Rendering and JavaScript engine improvements:** Chrome’s _RenderingNG_ architecture revamp (completed around 2021) made rendering more efficient. Specific tweaks like **upgrading image loading priority** (making sure LCP images aren’t blocked behind other less important tasks) and smarter garbage collection timing in V8 (to run during idle times) helped ensure smoother experiences[[53]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=,5)[[54]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=Improving%20garbage%20collection). In one case, Chrome developers found that the way cookies were accessed in a multi-process browser was causing jank – every document.cookie call had to synchronously fetch from a separate process. In a _“Fast and the Curious”_ deep-dive, they described how they optimized Chrome’s cookie access by introducing a **“shared memory versioning”** for cookies, eliminating many redundant process hops[[55]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=On%20the%20Chrome%20team%2C%20we,improving%20performance%20of%20the%20web)[[56]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=When%20looking%20at%20field%20data,cookies%20from%20the%20network%20service). This reduced input delays in cases where sites spammed cookie reads on every interaction. It’s a great example of low-level browser changes made in response to observing poor CWV (in this case, INP) in real-world traces.

All these optimizations in Chrome have made a measurable difference. By late 2023, Google reported that _the average page load in Chrome was_ _166 ms faster than before Core Web Vitals existed[[57]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=The%20results%20we%20saw%20after,substantial%20impact%20on%20the%20web). That may sound small, but across the whole web it is huge: **summing up the saved time, Chrome’s team calculated that in 2023 alone, speed improvements saved users over 10,000 years of cumulative waiting time for pages to load, and an additional 1,200+ years of waiting for pages to respond to input (thanks to interactivity improvements)**[[58]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=So%20far%20in%202023%2C%20this,The%20Chrome%20Data). In other words, the web literally got *years_ snappier for everyone. The share of traffic that meets the CWV “good” criteria also rose significantly.

When first announced, roughly 1/3 of page loads were good by CWV standards; by 2023, about 68% of desktop and 64% of mobile page visits** in Chrome met all three CWV thresholds[[59]](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html#:~:text=pages%20to%20load%20and%20over,The%20Chrome%20Data)[[60]](https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious#:~:text=match%20at%20L594%20many%20navigations,the%20end%20of%20the%20year). That’s nearly a doubling of well-performing experiences.
