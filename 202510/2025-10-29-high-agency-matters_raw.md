**A high-agency person steers their path instead of drifting with it.**

For generations, we’ve been told that a high IQ is the ticket to success. Top grades, test scores, and raw brainpower have been glorified as the holy grail of achievement. Yet a subtle revolution may be underway in how we understand success: in the long run, the thesis is that _initiative beats intellect_.

**“Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce [than intelligence].”** - Andrej Karpathy [[1]](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984?lang=en)

Recent insights - from tech leaders, psychologists, and entrepreneurs - suggest that **the capacity to take action, or personal agency, matters more than sheer intelligence in determining who thrives.** Karpathy, a renowned AI scientist, confessed that he “had this intuitively wrong for decades” due to our cultural veneration of IQ. Now he, and many others, recognize a paradigm shift: **being smart is useful, but being proactive and _doing something_ with that smarts is decisive.** In a world full of brilliant ideas and talented people, the real scarcity is those with the _agency_ to execute and make ideas happen.

This write-up will explore what “agency” really means, why it’s often the missing ingredient behind success, and how emphasizing initiative over intellect can transform careers - especially in engineering and technology fields. We’ll examine the pitfalls of relying solely on intelligence, why agency is rare (and precious), and how individuals and organizations can cultivate a high-agency mindset. In the end, it’s not a rejection of intelligence, but a recognition that **intelligence without action is like a car with no fuel** - potential energy that never turns into forward motion. To truly leverage our intellect, we must pair it with the drive to act. Let’s look at why taking initiative trumps IQ, and how you can apply this principle in your own life.

The essence of agency is being the driver, not the passenger.
-------------------------------------------------------------

**The high-agency mindset is simple. See it, own it, move it forward.**

At its core, _agency_ is the trait of being an active driver of your own life rather than a passive passenger. It’s the internal belief that _you can influence your circumstances_ and the willingness to actually do so. Psychologists describe agency as a blend of self-efficacy (confidence in your ability), determination, and ownership over outcomes. In simple terms, a high-agency person is the one who, when faced with a challenge or opportunity, says “**I’ll figure it out**” - and then proceeds to make it happen.

They don’t wait for instructions or perfect conditions; they _initiate and improvise_.

**“Someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it.”**

This concept is closely tied to having an **internal locus of control**, the belief that your actions largely determine your fate. People with high agency “lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate” [2](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984?lang=en) whereas low-agency individuals feel life is something that happens _to_ them. High-agency folks are the self-starters: they set goals and pursue them confidently even amid obstacles, adapting as needed. Notably, **agency isn’t the same as raw assertiveness or loud ambition**.

It’s often a quieter, internal resolve. It’s less about dominating others and more about conquering the tasks at hand. As Karpathy’s explanation puts it, _agency is the belief that you_ _can_ _act - paired with the will to follow through_.

Consider two software engineers on a team. One is brilliant but tends to wait until a manager gives detailed direction; when problems arise, they complain that the specs were unclear. The other is maybe not a “genius” on paper, but when they see a problem, they _take ownership_ to fix it - they teach themselves new tools if necessary, prototype solutions without being asked, and rally others to help. The second engineer is displaying high agency. She’s not content to sit idle because something wasn’t spelled out; she actively **shapes the outcome**.

Over time, that propensity to _do_ things - to drive projects forward - becomes far more valuable than whatever extra IQ points the first engineer might have. **Agency means seeing yourself as the protagonist in your story, not an extra waiting for directions.** It’s the mindset of driving the car rather than being along for the ride.

The action advantage is why initiative beats intelligence
---------------------------------------------------------

**Determination with average smarts beats brilliance without motion almost every time.**

Raw intelligence, as useful as it is, has diminishing returns beyond a point. What really separates high achievers is their propensity to act. As venture capitalist Paul Graham observes, an extremely smart but unmotivated person quickly becomes an “ineffectual but brilliant” individual, accomplishing little [[6]](https://youtu.be/4WO5kJChg3w?si=8iBdPx3t1xjoiYMH&t=2090).

**“It turns out it’s not that important to be smart. It’s much, much more important to be determined.”** - Paul Graham

In contrast, someone with dogged determination - even if not the brightest genius - will find a way to succeed. Graham illustrates this with a thought experiment: imagine a person who is 100/100 in intelligence and determination. If you dial down their determination, before long you get a genius who can’t get anything done. But if you dial down their intelligence while keeping determination maxed, you might end up with, say, a moderately smart business owner who still manages to get rich [[7]](https://www.littlealmanack.com/p/the-most-important-trait-for-success#:~:text=for%20smart%2C%20and%20a%20hundred,business%20or%20something%20like%20that). In his words, _“you can take away a lot of smart”_ and the determined person will still make progress [[8]](https://www.littlealmanack.com/p/the-most-important-trait-for-success#:~:text=of%20ineffectual%20but%20brilliant%20person,). **In the real world, a bias for action beats a surplus of IQ**.

Why is initiative such a powerful advantage? One reason is that **ideas are worthless until executed**. We all know of brilliant ideas that never left the paper. As entrepreneur Derek Sivers famously said, _“Ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.”_[[9]](https://sive.rs/multiply#:~:text=me%20to%20sign%20a%20non,tell%20me%20the%20simplest%20idea)[[10]](https://sive.rs/multiply#:~:text=Ideas%20are%20worth%20nothing%20unless,Execution%20is%20worth%20millions).

A genius idea with no action yields zero; a so-so idea implemented well can change the game. It’s the doing that makes the difference. Taking initiative also creates a compounding effect: when you act, you learn from real feedback, attract collaborators, and open doors. Even failures teach valuable lessons that no amount of contemplating could reveal. In contrast, the person who endlessly theorizes and polishes ideas in their head sees no real-world improvement.

Execution is a force multiplier on any talent or knowledge you possess. This is why many industry leaders value a “**bias toward action**.” Amazon, for example, preaches in its principles that _“Speed matters… Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study”_[[11]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles#:~:text=Bias%20for%20Action). In other words, don’t over-analyze everything - if a decision isn’t permanent, it’s often better to **do something and iterate** than to stall. The truth is that in most fields, _you can’t think your way to greatness; you have to_ _act_ _your way there._ Bold initiatives, even imperfect, move you forward. As one startup mantra puts it, “**Ship** it, then make it better.” A mediocre plan vigorously executed now is typically better than a perfect plan perpetually delayed.

We see the action advantage play out in career trajectories. The employee who volunteers for new projects, even without full expertise, ends up acquiring more skills and being seen as a leader - whereas a smarter colleague who sticks to their narrow role stagnates. Business history too shows that **the first mover who executes often beats competitors who might have had a “better” idea later**[[12]](https://www.inc.com/david-van-rooy/the-little-known-personality-trait-that-predicts-entrepreneurial-success.html#:~:text=1,Instead%20of). Simply put, you can’t win if you never leave the starting line, no matter how high your IQ. Meanwhile, even a slow runner who started the race will beat the speedster who never started. **This is why initiative is often called the great equalizer** - it allows an average Joe with hustle to outperform a brilliant but passive person over time.

When doing being too smart backfire?
------------------------------------

**“The problem is that intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.”** - Charles Bukowski [[13]](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/428040-the-problem-with-the-world-is-that-the-intelligent-people#:~:text=Goodreads%20www,ones%20are%20full%20of%20confidence)

If high intelligence is so great, why do so many “smart” people fall short of their potential? One counterintuitive truth is that being very smart can actually create its own pitfalls - what we might call _the intelligence trap_. One such pitfall is **analysis paralysis**. The more brainpower you have, the more adept you may be at imagining everything that could go wrong. Bright minds often overanalyze situations, seeking optimal solutions or perfect certainty. The result: they never act. As Bukowski’s darkly comic quote captures, intelligent people can be riddled with doubts and endless what-ifs, whereas those less preoccupied with perfection just charge ahead. In a startup or engineering project, this might mean the brilliant architect keeps refining an idea on paper, while a less “brilliant” team actually builds a prototype and starts gathering user feedback. By the time the perfectionist is confident, the opportunity has passed or others have iterated far beyond the initial concept.

Another facet of the intelligence trap is a **fear of failure, often bred by a fixed mindset**. Psychologist Carol Dweck found that people praised solely for being “smart” often develop an aversion to challenges - they don’t want to risk looking dumb or losing their smart status[[14]](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGwhmygIyyW/#:~:text=,PositivityInAction.%20more). This phenomenon, sometimes called _“smart kid syndrome,”_ leads to avoidance of tough problems and perseverance. Ironic as it sounds, an individual who’s always been the smartest in the room might crumble at a task that doesn’t come easily, because they’ve never learned to push through struggle. In contrast, those praised for effort or outcomes (not inherent genius) learn that trying and failing is just part of growth. As Dweck writes, _“teach children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning”_ - then they won’t be slaves to a fragile smart ego[[15]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/933935210588706/posts/1400399493942273/#:~:text=,to%20be%20slaves%20of%20praise). High agency people typically have this growth mindset; they see failure not as a verdict on their intellect but as a feedback mechanism for improvement.

Intelligence can also foster **overconfidence in planning** at the expense of doing. A very smart person might assume they can mentally simulate everything - leading them to underprepare or ignore practical testing. They trust their brain so much that they don’t get their hands dirty. Yet book smarts without street smarts can be disastrous. In engineering, you often don’t truly understand a system until you build it and break it a few times. The “doers” who tinker, experiment, and adapt end up with deeper intuition than those who only theorize. It’s telling that many top programmers and inventors talk about _“learning by doing”_ - an acknowledgment that no amount of pure analysis substitutes for experience. Tech legend Bruce Lee (though not an engineer) summed it up well: “**The doer alone learns**” [[16]](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-principle-from-amazon-s-team-will-change-your-life-e8e02220007b#:~:text=conceive%20of%20a%20perfect%20strategy,for%20weeks).

Finally, consider motivation. A person gifted with a high IQ might coast through early life without needing strong work habits or initiative - things come easily in school, for example. But when the real world presents complex, unstructured problems, raw IQ isn’t enough. Success becomes about persistence and proactivity. Those who coasted can struggle, while those who had to work hard and be resourceful from the start have the grit to keep going. This is why psychologist Angela Duckworth’s research on **grit** (passion and perseverance) found it to be a better predictor of success in many contexts than IQ. In studies of West Point cadets and spelling bee contestants, _grit out-predicted IQ for who made it through_[[17]](https://medium.com/@Mattssonm/my-new-years-resolution-is-to-everyday-write-at-least-500-words-on-my-novel-until-it-is-finished-1a755431c015#:~:text=conducted%20on%20competition%20participants%2C%20in,she%20explains%20it%20like%20this). As one summary put it, a child with high perseverance will outperform a child with a higher IQ if they simply practice longer and harder[[18]](https://medium.com/@Mattssonm/my-new-years-resolution-is-to-everyday-write-at-least-500-words-on-my-novel-until-it-is-finished-1a755431c015#:~:text=How%20much%20effort%20you%20put,who%20practiced%20for%20two%20years). Over time, the diligent “B student” can leave the genius “A student” in the dust - a common story in workplaces.

In short, **intelligence alone can lull you into complacency or fear-driven inaction**. The antidote is recognizing that _effort, learning, and adaptation trump sheer genius._ The best outcomes come when a sharp mind is paired with a bias for action. A brilliant plan is worthless if it remains in your head - or as Thomas Edison allegedly said, _“Vision without execution is hallucination.”_[[19]](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/664713#:~:text=Thomas%20A,Edison%20Quotes%20Next) To avoid the intelligence trap, one must cultivate the courage to act on imperfect information, the humility to learn from missteps, and the resilience to keep going when clever plans fail. Those qualities are all elements of **agency**.

Why agency is rare (and thus valuable)
--------------------------------------

**“Compliance is simple to measure, simple to test for and simple to teach… Initiative is very difficult to teach to 28 students in a quiet classroom.”** - Seth Godin [[20]](https://seths.blog/2010/02/its-easier-to-teach-compliance-than-initiative/#:~:text=Compliance%20is%20simple%20to%20measure%2C,compliance%2C%20reward%20obedience%20and%20repeat)

If taking initiative is so beneficial, one might wonder why it isn’t more common. The reality is that **agency is rare by design of both our institutions and our own psychology**. From early on, most people are conditioned to follow instructions and seek permission. Schools, for all the good they do, tend to reward compliance over initiative. As marketer Seth Godin points out, a teacher can grade correct answers easily, but it’s much harder to foster and evaluate original questioning or student-driven projects [[20]](https://seths.blog/2010/02/its-easier-to-teach-compliance-than-initiative/#:~:text=Compliance%20is%20simple%20to%20measure%2C,compliance%2C%20reward%20obedience%20and%20repeat). The result is an education system that produces excellent problem-solvers _within given parameters_, but **“we are seldom taught how to ask the next interesting question.”**[[21]](https://alanwu.xyz/posts/agency/#:~:text=,It%E2%80%99s%20much%20easier) Students learn that being a good student means doing the assigned work and not coloring outside the lines. By the time they enter the workforce, many have spent 16+ years in environments that implicitly say: _keep your head down and do as you’re told_. This inadvertently trains people _out of_ agency. They become uncomfortable with self-direction because they’ve had few chances to practice it.

Beyond schooling, there’s a comfort factor. **Being proactive is hard work** - it requires effort, risk, and stepping into the unknown. Human nature inclines us toward the path of least resistance. It’s far easier to let circumstances carry us along (the “default” life script) than to exert ourselves to change the status quo. High agency often means taking on extra responsibility and potential failure. Not everyone wants that burden. Psychologically, doing nothing (or doing only what you’re explicitly told) feels safer because you can’t be blamed if things go wrong. This leads to what some call **learned helplessness**: after long periods of being told what to do or feeling like you lack control, you stop looking for opportunities to assert control at all. Social commentator Simon Sarris notes that when young people are given years of “fake work” - busywork with no real impact - they unsurprisingly conclude that all work is meaningless and that they have no real power [[22]](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency#:~:text=accept%20responsibility%2C%20we%20have%20made,all%20honest%20educators%20note%20it)[[23]](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency#:~:text=Who%20could%20blame%20young%20adults,is%20a%20reality%20at%20all). They enter adulthood disillusioned or waiting for permission to do something meaningful. In such a state, agency withers; passivity becomes the norm.

Culturally, we’ve also only recently begun to celebrate initiative as a virtue. For much of the industrial age, **society valued reliable, compliant workers** - people who would show up on time and do the repetitive tasks required. The school system was in fact modeled to produce good factory workers and clerks. As Seth Godin remarked, companies historically “bought compliance by the bushel” and viewed too much initiative as a problem [[24]](https://seths.blog/2010/02/its-easier-to-teach-compliance-than-initiative/#:~:text=Schools%20like%20teaching%20compliance,pretty%20good%20at%20it). Only in the modern knowledge economy has creativity and self-direction become a prized asset in employees. So we’re undoing generations of messaging that said “Just do your job, don’t rock the boat.” This shift is happening, but unevenly. Many large organizations still implicitly discourage initiative beyond one’s role, smothering those who try to go above and beyond with bureaucracy. Thus, people learn to keep their heads down.

All these factors make agency scarce - which in turn makes it _incredibly valuable_. Think of supply and demand: plenty of smart, skilled individuals are out there, but relatively few who will take initiative without being prompted. So those who _do_ have high agency stand out and get disproportionate rewards. One analyst observed that **because so few people habitually “bend the universe” through their actions, the ones who do are in high demand**[[25]](https://alanwu.xyz/posts/agency/#:~:text=,rewarded%20in%20society). High-agency people also tend to attract followers; their confidence to act can inspire others who prefer to be led. It’s no coincidence that leadership roles (from team leads to entrepreneurs) gravitate towards those willing to say, “I’ll take charge.” As the saying goes, “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king” - in a world full of passive rule-followers, the person with a bit of initiative can quickly become a leader.

In essence, agency is rare because it requires unlearning some of our most ingrained habits and fears. But that rarity is exactly why cultivating it provides an edge.

**If you can break out of the compliance trap - if you maintain the mindset that you are an active agent of change - you immediately differentiate yourself.**

You become the person who creates opportunities instead of waiting for them. Yes, it’s harder and sometimes scarier to live this way, but the scarcity of peers doing the same means your efforts shine brighter. Every field has unsolved problems and untapped ideas; high-agency individuals are the ones who leap to fill those voids. The rest eventually benefit from their initiatives, but it’s the initiators who reap the biggest rewards (and often have the most interesting lives).

The real-world power of agency is turning ideas into impact
-----------------------------------------------------------

**“Vision without execution is hallucination.”** - Thomas Edison [[19]](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/664713#:~:text=Thomas%20A,Edison%20Quotes%20Next)

What does high agency look like in practice? It looks like **things getting done** - companies being launched, projects delivered against all odds, innovations brought to market, communities mobilized to solve problems. History and modern business alike show that the people who leave a mark are not necessarily the brainiest, but the ones who act on their vision. Thomas Edison, who held over a thousand patents, famously valued dogged execution. He’s credited with saying that genius is “1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.” Whether or not the percentage is accurate, the message is: **hard work and follow-through matter exponentially more than flashes of genius**. Edison himself was not the first to dream of electric light bulbs, but he was the one who relentlessly tested hundreds of materials until he found a filament that worked. That’s agency at work - the will to _do the boring, hard stuff_ to realize an idea.

In entrepreneurship, this principle is widely recognized. Venture investors often prefer a gritty founder who executes moderately well over a brilliant visionary who can’t implement. A study in _Frontiers in Psychology_ found that proactive personality (a proxy for personal agency) correlates much more strongly with career success - promotions, salary growth, satisfaction - than traits like conscientiousness or even intelligence [[26]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.979412/full#:~:text=continually%20influence%20individuals%27%20behavior%20and,personality%20could%20predict%20career%20success)[[27]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.979412/full#:~:text=success,initial%20causality%20evidence%20that%20proactive).

In fact, proactive individuals create their own luck. Because they _initiate_ often - starting new projects, reaching out to mentors, iterating on prototypes - they encounter more opportunities and learning experiences than passive peers. Over time, this leads to a compounding advantage. The proactive employee gets assigned to lead a high-profile project (because their boss trusts they’ll drive it forward), which then gives them exposure to executives and a chance to shine, leading to yet bigger opportunities. Meanwhile, equally “talented” but less proactive colleagues wonder why they’re being left behind.

A concrete example: think of two tech startups with a similar idea. One team builds a quick-and-dirty version of the product, puts it in users’ hands, and starts improving it. The other team spends the same time perfecting a theoretical model with no user feedback. It’s common that the first team, though their initial product is imperfect, will capture the market (or at least learn exactly what the market wants) by the time the second team is ready to debut. **Being the first to bring an idea to life can be a game-changer**[[12]](https://www.inc.com/david-van-rooy/the-little-known-personality-trait-that-predicts-entrepreneurial-success.html#:~:text=1,Instead%20of). Instagram, for instance, wasn’t the first photo-sharing idea, but its founders executed swiftly on mobile at a time others were stuck on web platforms. In business, we often hear of “first mover advantage,” but more accurately it’s _fast mover advantage_. The window for an opportunity often belongs to those who act decisively.

Agency also manifests in leadership and influence. High-agency individuals often end up leading not because they sought power for its own sake, but because _when something needed doing, they stepped up_. In a software team, if a critical bug is hurting users and nobody is explicitly assigned to it, the high-agency engineer will voluntarily take ownership to fix it. Before long, others come to rely on her initiative and perhaps even report to her as the team grows. High agency is infectious; it inspires confidence and cooperation. People are drawn to those who have a _“let’s get it done”_ attitude - it signals competence and reliability. Over time, an entire culture can form around such leaders, where execution and taking charge become the norm.

Crucially, agency turns ideas (which are abstract) into tangible results that benefit people. **All the great innovations - from the light bulb to the internet - required countless acts of initiative to materialize.** It’s not just the initial invention; maintaining and scaling any breakthrough also demands continuous proactive effort. Think about open-source software projects: many originate because a developer didn’t wait for someone else to solve their problem - they created a tool themselves and shared it. Linux, for example, started as Linus Torvalds’ personal project. He wasn’t necessarily the _most_ brilliant computer scientist alive, but he took the initiative to start building an operating system for fun. Now, Linux powers a significant portion of our digital world.

Even outside of tech, in fields like medicine or social change, agency is what moves the needle. The doctor who pioneers a new treatment does so by pushing through research hurdles, often against skepticism. Civil rights advancements were achieved by individuals willing to organize and act despite personal risk. In each case, **many people understood the problems intellectually, but only a few _acted_**. Those few changed history.

To sum up, **agency is the engine that converts knowledge into impact**. Intelligence, creativity, insight - these are the fuel and spark, but agency is the engine turning the crankshaft, driving the wheels. Without it, even the best ideas stall in the garage. With it, even a rough idea can gather momentum and become refined along the journey. This is why companies now talk about execution as a core skill and why phrases like “**real artists ship**” have become mottos in creative industries[[28]](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-principle-from-amazon-s-team-will-change-your-life-e8e02220007b#:~:text=Once%20you%20bias%20for%20action%2C,%E2%80%9D). It’s a recognition that **doing the work** is what ultimately matters. As one Amazon insider quipped, _“You can’t take over the world if you don’t act.”_[[29]](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles#:~:text=You%20can%E2%80%99t%20take%20over%20the,Amazon%E2%80%99s%20bias%20against) The world is indeed changed by those who _show up and do the work_, not by those who merely envision and procrastinate. Agency is what ensures you show up, again and again, until the job is done.

The Human advantage of AI can help with agency
----------------------------------------------

**“AI systems have got so useful that the thing that will set humans apart… is just having a high level of curiosity and agency.”** - Jack Clark [[30]](https://journeyed.com/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAI%20systems%20have%20got%20so,the%20era%20where%20these%20AI)

In the era of advanced Artificial Intelligence, one might ask: if machines can out-calculate and even out-reason humans in certain domains, what skill will keep us relevant? Tech leaders are increasingly pointing to _agency_ - our capacity to initiate, create, and drive - as the defining human advantage.

Andrej Karpathy noted that after decades of chasing smarter algorithms, **the scarce commodity now is human agency**[[31]](https://journeyed.com/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/#:~:text=In%20February%2C%20Andrej%20Karpathy%2C%20one,powerful%20and%20significantly%20more%20scarce). Jack Clark, co-founder of an AI company, observed that in a world where AI can supply answers or technical skills on demand, the differentiator between people will be _who has the curiosity and boldness to use these tools in novel ways_[[32]](https://journeyed.com/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAI%20systems%20have%20got%20so,%E2%80%9D). In other words, two people with access to the same AI may achieve very different outcomes - the one who proactively experiments and pushes boundaries will far outstrip the one who waits passively for the AI to spoon-feed solutions.

This suggests that **initiative is becoming even more important in the age of AI**, not less. Routine intelligence or knowledge (the kind measured by IQ tests or easily looked up) is increasingly handled by machines. What remains uniquely human is the drive to set goals, ask original questions, and take risks on new ventures.

An AI can process zettabytes of data and make recommendations, but it won’t _start_ a business on its own or decide to solve a local community problem unless a human agent prompts it. It’s the human user’s agency that directs AI toward meaningful objectives. As Clark puts it, people will “out-compete one another by being increasingly bold and agentic in how they use these systems” [[33]](https://journeyed.com/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAI%20systems%20have%20got%20so,%E2%80%9D). Two engineers with identical access to AI coding assistants, for example, might have very different productivity: the one with higher agency will try more ambitious projects, utilize the AI in clever ways, and swiftly move on ideas; the other might only use the AI when instructed and for narrow tasks.

We’re already seeing hints of this. Some professionals leverage AI tools to produce remarkable creative or analytical work - they are constantly asking the AI to help explore new concepts, generate prototypes, and so forth. Others with the same tools use them minimally, sticking to familiar routines. The gap isn’t the AI itself; it’s the human initiative behind it. **Curiosity**, the drive to tinker and learn, goes hand-in-hand with agency here. Highly agentic individuals tend also to be curious - they’ll dig into figuring out what an AI can do, thereby discovering advantages others miss. They treat the AI as an _enabler for their ideas_, not a crutch to avoid effort.

Education experts like Charles Fadel argue that in an AI-abundant world, we need to prioritize teaching _“the drivers: agency, identity, purpose, and motivation”_ to students [[34]](https://journeyed.com/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/#:~:text=In%20Education%20for%20the%20Age,agency%2C%20identity%2C%20purpose%20and%20motivation). Facts and routine skills can be offloaded to machines, but the inner drive of a person cannot be. Indeed, motivating oneself (and others) to act is becoming the critical skill. One could say humanity is moving up the value chain: from doing what computers can’t (which is less and less about calculation, and more about **initiative, empathy, and creativity**). Agency ties into all of those - a person with agency will seek creative solutions, will connect with others to rally support (something AI can’t replicate, as it lacks genuine social drive), and will adapt as circumstances change.

In short, as AI handles more “intelligent” tasks, _what remains scarce is human agency and leadership_. Those who develop these will not be easily replaced. In fact, they’ll be the ones directing the AI to new heights.
