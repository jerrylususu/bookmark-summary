#🤔Why YAML is the right devops technology for you🤔

#

#-100%test coverage,always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings,always shippable

#-no enforced error handling during development because runtime"panic at the disco"in production is dope

#-"something broke"is way better than stack tra ces with line numbers

#-you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline

#-safe choice with unquestionable industry adopt ion,"used by kubernetes"

#-is marginally better than windows.ini

#-unlike json[1][2],YAML supports comments

#-no official documentation(other than a specif ication for implementers)is totally fine

#-you need a super safe way to"execute this cod e"

#🍿wait a sec,did you say"executable yaml"??🍿

#🚨Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway🚨

#`NO`is parsed as a boolean type,which with the YAML 1.1 spec,there are 22 options to write"tru e"or"false."

#You have to wrap"NO"in quotes to get the expec ted result.

NI:Nicaragua

NL:Netherlands

NO:Norway#💣!

#🚨Anyone wondering why their first seven Kubernetes clusters deploy just fine,and the eighth fails?🚨

#Results in

#YAML knows that,when you have something that lo oks like the time of day,
