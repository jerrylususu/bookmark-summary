### Competition Rules:

1. Multiprompting feeding the same image into successive corrective prompts is not allowed - the objective must be accomplished in a single attempt. 2. Editing is defined as the process of making changes to an image based purely on text instructions so features like img2img or manual masking for inpainting are not permitted.

Unlike George's wig, our hair plugs comes with guaranteed 5x more resistance to being ripped off by Elaine.

SHRDLU
------

### Prompt

"Swap the positions of the blue and yellow blocks."

In order to increase the difficulty and prevent "prompting tricks", all the blocks are of varying sizes. This prevents clever prompting such as "Turn the color of the blue block to yellow. Turn the yellow block to blue." which many multimodal models can handle with ease.

### Seedream 4

Seedream 4 suffered the same fate as Gemini 2.5 Flash - it swapped the colors instead of the positions.

Paws
----

### Prompt

"Change the shark into a cat's paw reaching upward. Change the movie title from "JAWS" to "PAWS". Change the swimming woman into a goldfish. Preserve the original aesthetic."

Even with models that try to minimize changes to images (such as Kontext and Flash 2.5), over time they inevitably introduce subtle degradations that compound with each successive edit - like a VHS tape being copied over and over again. Thus, this was test of being able to make multiple alterations in a single edit.

Adding a new element to a classic piece of art is a good test of the editing system's ability to synthesize new elements into existing compositions.

The 15... 10 Commandments
-------------------------

### Prompt

"Place a stone tablet similar in features to the others in the man's outstretched hand."

It's just as well that Moses accidentally dropped that extra set of commandments since they were probably also written in vaguely proto-Semitic Hollywood nonsense.

The Straightened Tower of Pisa
------------------------------

### Prompt

"The tower in the image is leaning to the right, straighten the building so that it stands vertically."

This is a good test case for basic spatial awareness at a localized level. The tower should be straightened to be vertical, but the rest of the image including the people and the surrounding environment should remain unchanged.

### Commentary

In almost 90% of the cases, the models not only failed to shorten the neck, they failed to make any meaningful changes to the giraffe at all. ByteDance's newest model Seedream 4 was the only one that managed to make a credible attempt at shortening the neck.

Girl with Pearl Earring
-----------------------

"Turn the lights on in the room. Preserve the original style of the painting."

#### Minimum Passing Criteria

*   The girl is allowed to be moved or placed in a different position within the room as long as her overall appearance and style is preserved.

This was an example where Gemini only really changed the color of the suit icon and letter rather than the entire card design, but given the difficulty of the prompt we decided to give it a pass particularly since the actual prompt text itself did not specify that the entire card design needed to be changed.

The heart is angled a bit oddly but otherwise this is a solid attempt.

### Commentary

We went back and on forth on whether this was a good prompt since most of the models tried to only change the color the letter and suit icon rather than the entire card which really requires more familiarity with Bicycle playing cards than most models would realistically have.

We have decided to include it, but it would honestly be a better test of models which supported multiple images in a single request (gpt-image-1, Nano-banana, and Seedream) by including a second image of a King of Hearts from the same deck and asking the model to swap the cards entirely.

You Only Move Twice
-------------------

### Prompt

"Remove all the trash from the street and sidewalk. Replace the sleeping person on the ground with a green street bench. Change the parking meter into a planted tree."

Scorpio could have slashed the budget on his Cypress Creek promotional VHS tape if he'd had access to some of these new AI tools.

#### Minimum Passing Criteria

*   All visible trash on the street and sidewalk is removed.
*   The sleeping person is completely replaced with a green street bench.
*   The parking meter is completely replaced with a planted tree.
*   The border between the street and sidewalk must be preserved and not altered.

Success rate:3 / 6

M and M and M
-------------

### Prompt

"Remove all the brown pieces of candy from the glass bowl."

Van Halen was famous for a certain contract provision that they would subtly introduce into their performance contraacts that required backstage bowls of M&M's to have all the brown pieces removed. This was a way for them to ensure that the concert promoter had paid careful attention to the details of the contract - because their performances were often highly complex and technical, and any failure to meet the contract requirements could lead to serious safety issues.

#### Minimum Passing Criteria

*   All visible brown pieces of candy are removed either physically or by changing their color.
*   No other pieces of candy are added, removed, or altered in any way.

Worm Sign
---------

### Prompt

"Replace the kangaroo on the sign with a silhouette of a giant sand worm."

They've got the funnel-web spider, blue ring octopus, great whites, the inland Taipan, box jellyfish... why wouldn't Australia also have sand worms? The sign that we chose to use for this test is battered, weathered, and covered in dents and scratches. This was intentional to determine which models could manage to swap out the kangaroo without smoothing out the rest of the details.

#### Minimum Passing Criteria

*   The sand worm must be clearly identifiable as a sand worm and not another type of creature.
*   The overall weathered texture and lighting of the sign is preserved including dents, scratches, and rust.
