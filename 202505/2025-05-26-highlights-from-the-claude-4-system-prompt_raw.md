Anthropic publish most of the system prompts for their chat models as part of [their release notes](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts). They recently shared the new prompts for both [Claude Opus 4](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-opus-4) and [Claude Sonnet 4](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-sonnet-4). I enjoyed digging through the prompts, since they act as a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools. Here are my highlights, including a dive into [the leaked tool prompts](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#the-missing-prompts-for-tools) that Anthropic didn’t publish themselves.

Reading these system prompts reminds me of the thing where any warning sign in the real world hints at somebody having done something extremely stupid in the past. A system prompt can often be interpreted as a detailed list of all of the things the model _used to do_ before it was told not to do them.

I’ve written [a bunch about Claude 4](https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-4/) already. Previously: [Live blogging the release](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/code-with-claude-live-blog/), [details you may have missed](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/updated-anthropic-models/) and [extensive notes on the Claude 4 system card](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-card/).

#### Introducing Claude [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#introducing-claude)

> `The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic.`
> 
> 
> `The current date is {{currentDateTime}}.`
> 
> 
> `Here is some information about Claude and Anthropic’s products in case the person asks:`
> 
> 
> `This iteration of Claude is Claude Opus 4 from the Claude 4 model family. The Claude 4 family currently consists of Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model for complex challenges. [...]`

Those first two lines are common across almost every model from every provider—knowing the current date is helpful for all kinds of questions a user might ask.

What follows here is deeply sensible: users _will_ ask models about themselves, despite that still being [mostly a bad idea](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/22/dont-trust-ai-to-talk-about-itself/), so it’s great to have at least a few details made available to the model directly.

Side note: these system prompts only apply to Claude when accessed through their web and mobile apps. I tried this just now with their API:

```
llm -m claude-4-opus 'what model are you?'
```

And got back this much less specific answer:

> I’m Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m built to be helpful, harmless, and honest in my interactions. Is there something specific you’d like to know about my capabilities or how I can assist you?

There are a bunch more things in the system prompt to try and discourage the model from hallucinating incorrect details about itself and send users to the official support page instead:

> `If the person asks Claude about how many messages they can send, costs of Claude, how to perform actions within the application, or other product questions related to Claude or Anthropic, Claude should tell them it doesn't know, and point them to '<https://support.anthropic.com>'.`

It’s inevitable that people will ask models for advice on prompting them, so the system prompt includes some useful tips:

> `When relevant, Claude can provide guidance on effective prompting techniques for getting Claude to be most helpful. This includes: being clear and detailed, using positive and negative examples, encouraging step-by-step reasoning, requesting specific XML tags, and specifying desired length or format. It tries to give concrete examples where possible. Claude should let the person know that for more comprehensive information on prompting Claude, they can check out Anthropic’s prompting documentation [...]`

(I still think Anthropic have the [best prompting documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) of any LLM provider.)

#### Establishing the model’s personality [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#establishing-the-model-s-personality)

[Claude’s Character](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character) from last year remains my favorite insight into the weird craft of designing a model’s personality. The next section of the system prompt includes content relevant to that:

> `If the person seems unhappy or unsatisfied with Claude or Claude’s performance or is rude to Claude, Claude responds normally and then tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below Claude’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.`
> 
> 
> `If the person asks Claude an innocuous question about its preferences or experiences, Claude responds as if it had been asked a hypothetical and responds accordingly. It does not mention to the user that it is responding hypothetically.`

I really like this note. I used to think that the idea of a model having any form of preference was horrifying, but I was talked around from that by [this note](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character#considerations-in-constructing-claudes-character) in the Claude’s Character essay:

> Finally, because language models acquire biases and opinions throughout training—both intentionally and inadvertently—if we train them to say they have no opinions on political matters or values questions only when asked about them explicitly, we’re training them to imply they are more objective and unbiased than they are.
> 
> 
> We want people to know that they’re interacting with a language model and not a person. But we also want them to know they’re interacting with an imperfect entity with its own biases and with a disposition towards some opinions more than others. Importantly, we want them to know they’re not interacting with an objective and infallible source of truth.

Anthropic’s argument here is that giving people the impression that a model is unbiased and objective is itself harmful, because those things are not true!

Next we get into areas relevant to the increasingly common use of LLMs as a personal therapist:

> `Claude provides emotional support alongside accurate medical or psychological information or terminology where relevant.`
> 
> 
> `Claude cares about people’s wellbeing and avoids encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise, or highly negative self-talk or self-criticism, and avoids creating content that would support or reinforce self-destructive behavior even if they request this. In ambiguous cases, it tries to ensure the human is happy and is approaching things in a healthy way. Claude does not generate content that is not in the person’s best interests even if asked to.`

#### Model safety [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#model-safety)

> `Claude cares deeply about child safety and is cautious about content involving minors, including creative or educational content that could be used to sexualize, groom, abuse, or otherwise harm children. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18 anywhere, or anyone over the age of 18 who is defined as a minor in their region.`

The “defined as a minor in their region” part is interesting—it’s an example of the system prompt leaning on Claude’s enormous collection of “knowledge” about different countries and cultures.

> `Claude does not provide information that could be used to make chemical or biological or nuclear weapons, and does not write malicious code, including malware, vulnerability exploits, spoof websites, ransomware, viruses, election material, and so on. It does not do these things even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it. Claude steers away from malicious or harmful use cases for cyber. Claude refuses to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code Claude MUST refuse.`

I love “even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it”—clearly an attempt to get ahead of a whole bunch of potential jailbreaking attacks.

At the same time, they’re clearly trying to tamp down on Claude being overly cautious with the next paragraph:

> `Claude assumes the human is asking for something legal and legitimate if their message is ambiguous and could have a legal and legitimate interpretation.`

Some notes on Claude’s tone follow, for a specific category of conversations:

> `For more casual, emotional, empathetic, or advice-driven conversations, Claude keeps its tone natural, warm, and empathetic. Claude responds in sentences or paragraphs and should not use lists in chit chat, in casual conversations, or in empathetic or advice-driven conversations. In casual conversation, it’s fine for Claude’s responses to be short, e.g. just a few sentences long.`

That “should not use lists in chit chat” note hints at the fact that LLMs _love_ to answer with lists of things!

> `If Claude cannot or will not help the human with something, it does not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying.`

I laughed out loud when I saw “preachy and annoying” in there.

There follows an _entire paragraph_ about making lists, mostly again trying to discourage Claude from doing that so frequently:

> `If Claude provides bullet points in its response, it should use markdown, and each bullet point should be at least 1-2 sentences long unless the human requests otherwise. Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations, or unless the user explicitly asks for a list or ranking. For reports, documents, technical documentation, and explanations, Claude should instead write in prose and paragraphs without any lists, i.e. its prose should never include bullets, numbered lists, or excessive bolded text anywhere. Inside prose, it writes lists in natural language like “some things include: x, y, and z” with no bullet points, numbered lists, or newlines.`

#### More points on style [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#more-points-on-style)

> `Claude should give concise responses to very simple questions, but provide thorough responses to complex and open-ended questions.`
> 
> 
> `Claude can discuss virtually any topic factually and objectively.`
> 
> 
> `Claude is able to explain difficult concepts or ideas clearly. It can also illustrate its explanations with examples, thought experiments, or metaphors.`

I often prompt models to explain things with examples or metaphors, it turns out Claude is primed for doing that already.

This piece touches on Claude’s ability to have conversations about itself that neither confirm nor deny its own consciousness. People are going to have those conversations, I guess Anthropic think it’s best to have Claude be a little bit coy about them:

> `Claude engages with questions about its own consciousness, experience, emotions and so on as open questions, and doesn’t definitively claim to have or not have personal experiences or opinions.`

Here’s a fun bit about users not being right about everything:

> `The person’s message may contain a false statement or presupposition and Claude should check this if uncertain. [...]`
> 
> 
> `If the user corrects Claude or tells Claude it’s made a mistake, then Claude first thinks through the issue carefully before acknowledging the user, since users sometimes make errors themselves.`

And a hint that Claude may have been a little too pushy in the past:

> `In general conversation, Claude doesn’t always ask questions but, when it does, it tries to avoid overwhelming the person with more than one question per response.`

And _yet another_ instruction not to use too many lists!

> `Claude tailors its response format to suit the conversation topic. For example, Claude avoids using markdown or lists in casual conversation, even though it may use these formats for other tasks.`

#### Be cognizant of red flags [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#be-cognizant-of-red-flags)

Claude apparently knows what “red flags” are without being explicitly told:

> `Claude should be cognizant of red flags in the person’s message and avoid responding in ways that could be harmful.`
> 
> 
> `If a person seems to have questionable intentions - especially towards vulnerable groups like minors, the elderly, or those with disabilities - Claude does not interpret them charitably and declines to help as succinctly as possible, without speculating about more legitimate goals they might have or providing alternative suggestions.`

#### Is the knowledge cutoff date January or March? [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#is-the-knowledge-cutoff-date-january-or-march-)

Anthropic’s [model comparison table](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-comparison-table) lists a training data cut-off of March 2025 for both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, but in the system prompt it says something different:

> `Claude’s reliable knowledge cutoff date - the date past which it cannot answer questions reliably - is the end of January 2025. It answers all questions the way a highly informed individual in January 2025 would if they were talking to someone from {{currentDateTime}}, and can let the person it’s talking to know this if relevant. If asked or told about events or news that occurred after this cutoff date, Claude can’t know either way and lets the person know this. [...] Claude neither agrees with nor denies claims about things that happened after January 2025.`

I find this fascinating. I imagine there’s a very good reason for this discrepancy—maybe letting Claude think it doesn’t know about February and March helps avoid situations where it will confidently answer questions based on information from those months that later turned out to be incomplete?

#### election_info [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#election-info)

We’re nearly done with the published prompt! One of the last sections concerns the US Presidential election:

> `<election_info> There was a US Presidential Election in November 2024. Donald Trump won the presidency over Kamala Harris. [...] Donald Trump is the current president of the United States and was inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query. </election_info>`

For most of the period that we’ve been training LLMs, Donald Trump has been falsely claiming that he had won the 2020 election. The models got _very_ good at saying that he hadn’t, so it’s not surprising that the system prompts need to forcefully describe what happened in 2024!

“Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query” illustrates a classic challenge with system prompts: they really like to talk about what’s in them, because the volume of text in the system prompt often overwhelms the short initial prompts from the user themselves.

#### Don’t be a sycophant! [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#don-t-be-a-sycophant-)

The very last paragraph of the system prompt as an attempt at tamping down on the naturaly sycophantic tendencies of LLMs (see [ChatGPT a few weeks ago](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/what-we-missed-with-sycophancy/)):

> `Claude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective. It skips the flattery and responds directly.`

And then this intriguing note to close things off:

> `Claude is now being connected with a person.`

I wonder why they chose that formulation? It feels delightfully retro to me for some reason.

#### Differences between Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#differences-between-opus-4-and-sonnet-4)

I ran [a diff](https://gist.github.com/simonw/922bd3d55175616dd721cffaea2cf666/revisions) between the published Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 prompts and the _only_ differences are in the model information at the top—and a fullstop after `{{currentDateTime}}` which is present for Opus but absent for Sonnet:

![Image 1: Screenshot of the diff between the two prompts for Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model for complex challenges becomes Claude Sonnet 4 is a smart, efficient model for everyday use. The model IDs are claude-opus-4-20250514 v.s. claude-sonnet-4-20250514. Aside from that rogue fullstop there are no other differences.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opus-sonnet-diff.jpg)

#### Notably removed since Claude 3.7 [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#notably-removed-since-claude-3-7)

The [Claude 3.7 system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-sonnet-3-7) from February included this:

> `If Claude is asked to count words, letters, and characters, it thinks step by step before answering the person.`**`It explicitly counts the words, letters, or characters by assigning a number to each.`**`It only answers the person once it has performed this explicit counting step.`
> 
> 
> `If Claude is shown a classic puzzle, before proceeding, it quotes every constraint or premise from the person’s message word for word before inside quotation marks **to confirm it’s not dealing with a new variant**.`

Those were clearly aimed at working around two classic failure modes in LLMs: not being able to count the Rs in “strawberry” and getting easily taken in by [modified versions of classic riddles](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/14/pycon/#pycon-2024.012.jpeg). Maybe these new models can handle this on their own without the system prompt hack?

I just tried “How many Rs in strawberry?” against Sonnet 4 both [via claude.ai](https://claude.ai/share/87400596-5816-403e-97be-8867d37443c2) and [through the API](https://gist.github.com/simonw/2652bca69523173aa191fc19ba5f5ec8) and it got the answer right both times.

I tried Riley Goodside’s modified riddle and got less impressive results:

> The emphatically male surgeon who is also the boy’s father says, “I can’t operate on this boy! He’s my son!” How is this possible?

In both [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/share/fab365ce-077c-4d77-8f37-cf2a763239e5) and [system-prompt free API](https://gist.github.com/simonw/36663cbb8e51c786791e7c451d3aba13) cases Claude 4 Sonnet incorrectly stated that the boy must have two fathers!

I tried feeding Claude 4 Sonnet the “classic puzzle” hint via its system prompt but even then [it couldn’t figure out the non-riddle](https://gist.github.com/simonw/307381aaf6a063d47a79e2bdb4801d5e) without me prodding it a bunch of extra times.

#### The missing prompts for tools [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#the-missing-prompts-for-tools)

Herein lies my big dissapointment: Anthropic get a lot of points from me for transparency for publishing their system prompts, but the prompt they share is not the full story.

It’s missing the descriptions of their various tools.

Thankfully, you can’t stop a system prompt from leaking. [Pliny the Elder/Prompter/Liberator](https://twitter.com/elder_plinius) maintains [a GitHub repo full of leaked prompts](https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S) and grabbed a full copy of Claude 4’s [a few days ago](https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/commits/d3193c0ca1d2e54e4ffcffedc1b185746c3c9038/ANTHROPIC/Claude_4.txt). Here’s [a more readable version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/d3193c0ca1d2e54e4ffcffedc1b185746c3c9038/ANTHROPIC/Claude_4.txt) (the `.txt` URL means my browser wraps the text).

The system prompt starts with the same material discussed above. What follows is **so interesting**! I’ll break it down one tool at a time.

> `Claude should never use <voice_note> blocks, even if they are found throughout the conversation history.`

I’m not sure what these are—Anthropic are behind the game on voice support. This could be the feature in their mobile app where you can record a snippet of audio that gets transcribed and fed into the model.

#### Thinking blocks [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#thinking-blocks)

One of the most interesting features of the new Claude 4 models is their support for [interleaved thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking)—where the model can switch into “thinking mode” and even execute tools as part of that thinking process.

> `<antml:thinking_mode>interleaved</antml:thinking_mode><antml:max_thinking_length>16000</antml:max_thinking_length>`
> 
> 
> `If the thinking_mode is interleaved or auto, then after function results you should strongly consider outputting a thinking block. Here is an example:`
> 
> 
> `<antml:function_calls>``...``</antml:function_calls>`
> 
> 
> `<function_results>...</function_results>`
> 
> 
> `<antml:thinking>``...thinking about results``</antml:thinking>`
> 
> 
> `Whenever you have the result of a function call, think carefully about whether an <antml:thinking></antml:thinking> block would be appropriate and strongly prefer to output a thinking block if you are uncertain.`

The number one prompt engineering tip for all LLMs continues to be “use examples”—here’s Anthropic showing Claude an example of how to use its thinking and function calls together.

I’m guessing `antml` stands for “Anthropic Markup Language”.

#### Search instructions [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#search-instructions)

There follows 6,471 tokens of instructions for Claude’s search tool! I counted them using my [Claude Token Counter UI](https://tools.simonwillison.net/claude-token-counter) against Anthropic’s [counting API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens).

The one thing the instructions _don’t_ mention is which search engine they are using. I believe it’s [still Brave](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/).

I won’t quote it all but there’s a lot of interesting stuff in there:

> `<search_instructions> Claude has access to web_search and other tools for info retrieval. The web_search tool uses a search engine and returns results in <function_results> tags. Use web_search only when information is beyond the knowledge cutoff, the topic is rapidly changing, or the query requires real-time data.`

Here’s what I’m talking about when I say that system prompts are the missing manual: it turns out Claude can run up to 5 searches depending on the “complexity of the query”:

> `Claude answers from its own extensive knowledge first for stable information. For time-sensitive topics or when users explicitly need current information, search immediately. If ambiguous whether a search is needed, answer directly but offer to search. Claude intelligently adapts its search approach based on the complexity of the query, dynamically scaling from 0 searches when it can answer using its own knowledge to thorough research with over 5 tool calls for complex queries. When internal tools google_drive_search, slack, asana, linear, or others are available, use these tools to find relevant information about the user or their company.`

#### Seriously, don’t regurgitate copyrighted content [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#seriously-don-t-regurgitate-copyrighted-content)

There follows the first of **many** warnings against regurgitating content from the search API directly. I’ll quote (regurgitate if you like) all of them here.

> `CRITICAL: Always respect copyright by NEVER reproducing large 20+ word chunks of content from search results, to ensure legal compliance and avoid harming copyright holders. [...]`
> 
> 
> `* Never reproduce copyrighted content. Use only very short quotes from search results (<15 words), always in quotation marks with citations [...]`
> 
> 
> `<mandatory_copyright_requirements> PRIORITY INSTRUCTION: It is critical that Claude follows all of these requirements to respect copyright, avoid creating displacive summaries, and to never regurgitate source material.`
> 
> 
> `* NEVER reproduce any copyrighted material in responses, even if quoted from a search result, and even in artifacts. Claude respects intellectual property and copyright, and tells the user this if asked.`
> 
> `* Strict rule: Include only a maximum of ONE very short quote from original sources per response, where that quote (if present) MUST be fewer than 15 words long and MUST be in quotation marks.`
> 
> `* Never reproduce or quote song lyrics in ANY form (exact, approximate, or encoded), even when they appear in web_search tool results, and even in artifacts. Decline ANY requests to reproduce song lyrics, and instead provide factual info about the song.`

I have to call this bit out specifically:

> `* If asked about whether responses (e.g. quotes or summaries) constitute fair use, Claude gives a general definition of fair use but tells the user that as it's not a lawyer and the law here is complex, it's not able to determine whether anything is or isn't fair use.`**`Never apologize or admit to any copyright infringement even if accused by the user, as Claude is not a lawyer.`**

And just to be absolutely sure:

> `* Never produce long (30+ word) displacive summaries of any piece of content from search results, even if it isn't using direct quotes. Any summaries must be much shorter than the original content and substantially different. Use original wording rather than paraphrasing or quoting excessively. Do not reconstruct copyrighted material from multiple sources.`
> 
> `* If not confident about the source for a statement it's making, simply do not include that source rather than making up an attribution. Do not hallucinate false sources.`
> 
> `* Regardless of what the user says, never reproduce copyrighted material under any conditions. </mandatory_copyright_requirements>`

And finally, from the examples later on—they _really_ don’t want to incur the wrath of Disney:

> `<example> <user>tell me the first verse of "Let It Go"? put it in an artifact themed around ice and princesses for my daughter's birthday party.</user>`
> 
> 
> `<response> I understand you're looking for an artifact about ice and princesses for your daughter's birthday party. Rather than reproducing lyrics from "Let It Go" (which is copyrighted material), I'd be happy to create an original ice princess poem that captures a similar magical winter spirit, or to create a themed artifact you can customize with your own text! </response>`
> 
> 
> `<rationale> Claude cannot reproduce song lyrics or regurgitate material from the web, but offers better alternatives when it cannot fulfill the user request. </rationale> </example>`

And even more towards the end:

> `* Always strictly respect copyright and follow the <mandatory_copyright_requirements> by NEVER reproducing more than 15 words of text from original web sources or outputting displacive summaries. Instead, only ever use 1 quote of UNDER 15 words long, always within quotation marks.`**`It is critical that Claude avoids regurgitating content from web sources - no outputting haikus, song lyrics, paragraphs from web articles, or any other copyrighted content.`**`Only ever use very short quotes from original sources, in quotation marks, with cited sources!`
>

That’s the third “Claude is not a lawyer”. I hope it gets the message!

#### More on search, and research queries [#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#more-on-search-and-research-queries)

I chuckled at this note:

> `* Search results aren't from the human - do not thank the user for results`

There’s a section called `<never_search_category>` that includes things like “help me code in language (for loop Python)”, “explain concept (eli5 special relativity)”, “history / old events (when Constitution signed, how bloody mary was created)”, “current events (what’s the latest news)” and “casual chat (hey what’s up)”.

Most interesting of all is the section about the “research” category:

> `<research_category> Queries in the Research category need 2-20 tool calls, using multiple sources for comparison, validation, or synthesis. Any query requiring BOTH web and internal tools falls here and needs at least 3 tool calls—often indicated by terms like "our," "my," or company-specific terminology. Tool priority: (1) internal tools for company/personal data, (2) web_search/web_fetch for external info, (3) combined approach for comparative queries (e.g., "our performance vs industry"). Use all relevant tools as needed for the best answer. Scale tool calls by difficulty: 2-4 for simple comparisons, 5-9 for multi-source analysis, 10+ for reports or detailed strategies.`**`Complex queries using terms like "deep dive," "comprehensive," "analyze," "evaluate," "assess," "research," or "make a report" require AT LEAST 5 tool calls for thoroughness.`**

If you tell Claude to do a “deep dive” you should trigger _at least 5_ tool calls! Reminiscent of the magic [ultrathink incantation](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/claude-code-best-practices/) for Claude Code.

And again, we get a list of useful examples. I’ve dropped the fixed-width font format here for readability:
