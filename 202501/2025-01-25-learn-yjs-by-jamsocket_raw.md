Markdown Content:
Welcome to **Learn Yjs** — an interactive tutorial series on building _realtime collaborative applications_ using the [Yjs CRDT library](https://github.com/yjs/yjs).

This very page is an example of a realtime collaborative application. Every other cursor in the garden above is a _real live person_ reading the page right now. Click one of the plants to change it for everyone else!

Learn Yjs starts with the basics of Yjs, then covers techniques for handling state in distributed applications. We’ll talk about what a CRDT is, and why you’d want to use one. We’ll get into some of the pitfalls that make collaborative applications difficult and show how you can avoid them. There will be _explorable demos_ and _code exercises_ so you can get a feel for how Yjs really works.

Here’s an example of an explorable demo. Each box below represents a _client_ — a separate computer running an app that uses Yjs. When you interact with either client, the changes are _automatically synced_ to the other one. You can control the latency with the slider on the top left to see how clients would interact over a network.
