![Image 98: Post image for Everything Must Be Paid for Twice](https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/claudia-rancourt-yEp5-D-JthU-unsplash.jpg)One financial lesson they should teach in school is that most of the things we buy have to be paid for twice.

There’s the first price, usually paid in dollars, just to gain possession of the desired thing, whatever it is: a book, a budgeting app, a unicycle, a bundle of kale.

But then, in order to make use of the thing, you must also pay a second price. This is the effort and initiative required to gain its benefits, and it can be much higher than the first price.

A new novel, for example, might require twenty dollars for its first price—and ten hours of dedicated reading time for its second. Only once the second price is being paid do you see any return on the first one. Paying only the first price is about the same as throwing money in the garbage.

Likewise, after buying the budgeting app, you have to set it all up, and learn to use it habitually before it actually improves your financial life. With the unicycle, you have to endure the presumably painful beginner phase before you can cruise down the street. The kale must be de-veined, chopped, steamed, and chewed before it gives you any nourishment.

If you look around your home, you might notice many possessions for which you’ve paid the first price but not the second. Unused memberships, unread books, unplayed games, unknitted yarns.

I can’t know for sure, but I have the sense that in pre-consumer societies, there was less emphasis on paying first prices (i.e. getting things into your possession) and much more on paying second prices—doing the work necessary to use what you have, and becoming someone who always does. Imagine a plow, purchased for its features, but which never gets pulled through the earth.

The miracle of industrialization has reduced many first prices tremendously, but has also given us many more of them to consider paying. With all the wonderful toys on offer, almost nobody feels like they have quite enough money, enough acquisition power. When a person receives a windfall, they immediately think of more first prices they can now pay.

But no matter how many cool things you acquire, you don’t gain any more time or energy with which to pay their second prices—to use the gym membership, to read the unabridged classics, to make the ukulele sound good—and so their rewards remain unredeemed.

I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase – the reason we buy it at all — stay locked up until _both_ prices are paid.

For example, you can pick up _Moby-Dick_ for a dollar at a garage sale, but it’s a wasted dollar if you don’t subsequently pay a significant second price: sixteen hours of attending closely to long Victorian commentaries on whales and the men who hunt them. And you’ve got many more debts competing for those same sixteen hours — the more first prices you’ve paid alongside this garage sale dollar, the less you feel like you’ll ever have time to properly experience the legend of Captain Ahab, or do any other elective activities that require effort and initiative.

This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.

The only solution I can think of is to consciously throw the switch the other way: avoid paying any more needless first prices, and set your lifestyle around paying certain second prices, so you can finally enjoy the long-promised prizes waiting in your bookshelf, storage room, and hard drive. This was my original intuition behind the [Depth Year](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/) concept—to designate a whole year in which you stop acquiring more _ways to do_ cool things, and start doing the cool things in earnest.

(If you think you might want to do a Depth Year in 2022, feel free to join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2048565808760384).)

Paying a second price, unpleasant as it sounds, is a process you can acquire a taste for, and when you do, it’s exhilarating. It’s like picking your way through unmapped wilderness – the going is slow and there’s lots to trip over, but it’s new territory the whole way, and after the initial discomfort you feel very alive. Then when you come out the other side, this new territory has become part of your usual range, and you’re tougher and more interesting.

Figuring out how to pay the second price isn’t hard. You just have to notice that moment you usually think about packing it in, and stay with it instead of doing something else.

In other words, when you hit the weeds, you go into them instead of away. The awkward B major chord on the guitar – get your fingers in place anyway, and see if you can relax into the position just a bit more. The part where Ishmael goes on at length about historical whale drawings – try to understand why it matters to him. It is in these unfamiliar moments that the rewards appear.

I’ve bought a lot of books on topics I want to learn and falsely feel like when I am buying these books I’ve acquired the “knowledge” from them – with the attitude that of course I will read/study them to improve my career. They stare at me from my bookshelf, mostly unopened. There are plenty of non-book acquisitions I have with the same issue (eg. knife stones, craft supplies). This is a big issue for me. “Second price” is a great way of framing it. Also the price of caring/maintaining for physical objects as well should be included in “Second Price”.  
Point overall well taken – thank you David.  
Thank you for your productivity book, it has been helping. I hope it continues to do so.

Yes! That is the illusion: that we acquire the benefits from the thing when we buy it, as though the reading of the book follows automatically. That’s actually one of the reasons I made How to Do Things so short — to minimize the second cost so people can get to the rewarding part. And it seems to really work for people, even though the first cost ($23) is probably more than anyone is used to paying for a 35-page book.

It’s interesting that we must pay for something like knife stones by working however many hours at a job, but the self-directed work of learning to use it somehow feels daunting enough to avoid, even though it probably only takes a few minutes, requires little actual work, and would pretty quickly become rewarding. I’m the exact same.

Awesome post! As I was reading, I felt that we often pay twice especially for unhealthy food, since its second price is huge cause you will eventually have to pay a lot in terms of medicines and hospitals in the long run.

The idea of a depth year sounds fascinating, but I quit Facebook a few years ago. Rejoining Facebook in order to start a year of focus seems unwise.

Thank you. Wise words indeed. I also stopped using Facebook. I have done some reading since but have a long way to go. The second price is so true. We all of something we want. We have it two days and its lost it’s luster.

Awesome perspective David, as usual! And then there is the price of managing the object itself in your home: finding a place to put it, clean it regularly, finding a way to give it when you don’t want it anymore but you don’t want to throw it away….

[![Image 107](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/298e74de73111ae4b4894aa10f1b8223?s=60&d=mm&r=pg)](https://www.raptitude.com/) [David Cain](https://www.raptitude.com/) [January 20, 2022 at 9:18 am](https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/#comment-117878 "Permalink to this comment")

For sure. Having and using an object (second price) is a lot more complicated and ongoing than the ephemeral experience of buying it (first price).

So true. I feel I achieve something when I buy a book, but I have many I have not yet read.

But there is also perhaps a third price and a fourth price too. The third ‘cost’ of deciding to give up on something and then the ‘cost’ of actually removing/recycling it. It has always been more difficult to give up something you already own than to obtain it, and now there is so much ‘stuff’ in the world that well intentioned people make it increasingly difficult to get rid of it.

That’s a huge karmic burden to cope with. Better to not step on the ownership treadmill in the first place perhaps?

I am currently culling all of my possessions, and you are totally right. It is an immense amount of labor just to LOOK AT all my possessions, and even more to bag them up and donate them. And these are just ones I’ve decided not to pay the second price for.

Indeed, just the looking, analyzing, and overthinking can be psychologically overwhelming!

Part of the issue with this whole subject is our current obsession with individual ownership. I grew up in a frugal household- when considering buying anything we had to ask ourselves – how much would we use it, could you borrow one, could you share one, could you use someone’s old one, could you get it from the library?  
The primary reason for this was lack of money, needing to get full value for whatever we spent. But it also took a lot of that “second price time” pressure off, because we weren’t expecting to \*own\* everything we used. If you didn’t read a book, you returned it to the library – it didn’t sit on the shelf mocking you.

[![Image 112](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/298e74de73111ae4b4894aa10f1b8223?s=60&d=mm&r=pg)](https://www.raptitude.com/) [David Cain](https://www.raptitude.com/) [January 20, 2022 at 9:27 am](https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/#comment-117882 "Permalink to this comment")

That’s a good point, and I suspect much of that obsession stems from how things are marketed. Ownership is emphasized because the product maker doesn’t gain anything from people lending it to each other, even though many household products could probably be borrowed/shared between neighbors. Lawn mowers come immediately to mind.

And then there is the price paid by our poor family or friends who have to deal with all we left behind when our time is over.

I’m also taking a closer look at the footprint I leave behind. Day to day waste, and the larger issue of what remains for family and friends to manage.

It takes time, but I’m staying dedicated, a little at a time. And being vigilant about first costs and what I’m allowing to enter my home.

This is so good. So true. You just pointed to the very thing I was thinking abt the other day, and how when I’m collecting these things (most often books but other things too) what I’m really doing is feeding my identity more than anything. And then when I don’t read/do the thing I have this guilt hovering that I’m reminded of every time I look at the thing. I loved your idea of a depth year when you wrote abt it and and although I didn’t follow that to a T, I have made a conscious effort to dive into what I already have rather than get the new shiny thing. Thank you. I love how you frame things.

Identity is a big part of the equation for sure. Buying a big thick Russian novel makes me feel like I’m part of the “Tolstoy club,” and maybe when people see my bookshelf they think I’ve read it. I haven’t, of course, and I may never, because there are so many other second costs to pay (i.e. other books). And I don’t intend to stop buying them (although the vast majority are bought used now).

This is SO spot on: “feeding my identity”. I used to buy a lot of books on different topics; some literature classics too as I felt I had to read them. I have read most of them but I feel as I’ve not retained much.  
Now I mostly read meditation and Dharma books, and I constantly go back to (almost) each of them; I’m currently reading J.Goldstein’s “Mindfulness” for the third time.

Love this post but one important oversight that actually makes your point even more relevant. We actually pay 3 times! We pay first through our time and skills invested, in order to earn the money it takes to buy these things that you are describing.

So when you add up the costs to acquire the money to purchase the thing, the cost of the thing itself (including the opportunity cost), and the cost of receiving the benefit of the thing, you get the true cost of any decision.

Hehe yeah there is probably an infinite regress of costs if we take the analogy further

Great post David,  
Your website is a breath of fresh air to me and answers a lot of the questions to struggles I deal with daily.  
Like another person posted, I seem to get enough out of the First Price to avoid wanting to pay the Second.  
The cabinets full of self help books, vitamins and exercise dvds only helps resurface the reason they were all bought in the first place.  
Like so many of the addictions I feel I’ve conquered I only have to look in my cabinets to see what I’ve replaced them with.  
Like they say ” the road to hell is paved with good intentions”  
I tell my wife ” Just let me buy the veggies, at least I feel good doing it”  
LOL  
Funny, I read something this morning along this line.

Keep fighting Bros and Sisters; Its that good feeling (reward) we get when we complete the Second Price (Just like David said) that makes all our struggles worth it.

Thanks Paul. A fair bit has been written about the superficial rewards of self-help books in particular. The first price gives you a sense that your life is about to improve, which creates a sense of relief. By the time it fades, even though nothing has changed, another book has caught your eye and the process repeats. Implementing the advice in self-help books is often very difficult, as it requires confronting lifelong fears, overcoming longstanding habits, and other notoriously difficult feats. Having said that, a small percentage of those books taught me things that did indeed change my life, and overall it was worth every penny (and hour) even for the useless ones.

I’m always blown away by David’s insight, but the thoughtful comments here are so good too! What a great community!

I would like to add:  
People who hoard have taught me that even free things have a cost. The cost is the space they take up in your home. If you fill your chairs, tables, sofas, and desks with free things, the cost is you don’t invite friends over because there’s nowhere for them to sit. Your children also can’t have friends over. Your spouse can’t host a game night for their friends. The price is often isolation.

And as someone else noted, there’s the price you pay when you decide to get rid of things. If you got it here in a truck, guess what? It has to leave in a truck.

If you’ll excuse me, I’ve realized I have a closet to clean out

I have a morbid curiosity with those hoarder reality shows, and I think it’s because I have enough of that first-cost bias to understand how it could happen, except that in the severe hoarder’s case, a certain feedback loop has taken over. It seems like such a difficult existence.

I bet we see a whole lot more folks who subscribe to the minimalist way of living as time goes by. We still have a good many of us who came from the depression era, or are the kids who grew up with parents from the depression era. Hubby’s maternal grandmother, as well as his Dad (his Mom wasn’t too bad about the ‘collecting’ of stuff’) were ‘collectors’ due to the depression and everything might have a use someday. Hubby’s Dad was REALLY a hoarder, and when he passed away, the one thing his Mom wanted us to do before we went home was to clean out the garage. It was SO FULL of old papers, magazines & other stuff it was ridiculous. He’d also put nails and screws and other stuff in coffee cans and had not touched them for so long that the bottoms of the cans were rusted and fell out, with the contents, when picked up. Hubby’s maternal grandmother passed away some thirty years ago, and we went with hubby’s Mom to the state her mother lived in to help clean out the house. Oh, wow, the basement had long shelves FULL of old rugs, towels, sheets that were not usable for their intended purpose any longer, but they were kept in case an occasion came up for it. Was that way all over the house in one way or another. What a lesson for both hubby and me. I have ended up being the one to head the minimalist route, but hubby still has a lot of his gathered-over-time-stuff, with no desire to reduce it. Hubby sees me de-cluttering and dis-owning (a word I just recently came across), so hopefully he will see the light and join me in the effort regarding HIS stuff!

We moved into our 40% larger “forever home” in August 2020 because we had a second child at the end of 2019.

Already, the home is fully utilized and overflowing with stuff. It feels so good to donate things. But the donation centers were closed all of 2020 and part of 2021.

The number of Amazon boxes and delivery packages for food and stuff every day feels so overwhelming. I want us to have a detox this month. But when you have two little ones at home, there is just an endless amount of things to buy as they are always changing and growing up so fast.

I really love this post Dave. I have sent it to my wife and we are going to give away more of the things we don’t use and spend energy consuming the things we have. That includes books, which we will then give away. And also my guitar, which is getting a little dusty now.

Lots of things to think about here. Thank you.

I was listening to the podcast Ephemeral last night (for the first time!) and it was about garbage. A historian said there was a 19 cen french saying “That’s not worth the candle.” She explained that because whale oil was so expensive, people had to weigh how much light was required to use what they bought…or to do what they were thinking of doing.

So interesting to get that message twice within 12 hours!

Ah now that is interesting… light as a scarce resource that has to be conserved for later. It seems as though the wild abundance of once-rare resources is part of the problem for us. If we had to ration our light we’d waste a lot less time doing pretty much anything, because almost everything requires light.

Interesting thoughts here!

The scarce-light resource leading to the rationing of light then infers that the premium on the second-cost would have been even higher than it is currently. In turn, this implies that our first-cost resources (ie: money) would be diminished: less light, less light by which to do things (ie: work) that can create more of those first-cost resources.

The conclusion that I draw from these points of thought is that light is as much a blessing as it is a curse: it gives us the ability to maximize our first-cost resources but in turn it distorts our perception of available second-cost resources (ie: time).

So what is the solution? Get rid of fire? Probably not. But can we all at least acknowledge that the tendency of humans is to use fire to maximize the spend of our time in exchange for ever-more money and that perhaps this is not a healthy way to live? Add to this fact that society makes fire, distorting the cost of basic living, and it feels like a solution that individuals can only partially resolve alone. By which I mean, it is not feasible for me to tell my boss that I want to work fewer hours in order to burn less fire b/c our abuse of fire is in some way immoral.

Sometimes my thought processes can be muddled; hopefully the above actually makes logical sense lol.

Wow.  
So eloquently written.
