How we’re making GitHub Copilot smarter with fewer tools
========================================================

We’re using embedding-guided tool routing, adaptive clustering, and a streamlined 13-tool core to deliver faster experience in VS Code.

In VS Code, GitHub Copilot Chat can access hundreds of tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that range from codebase analysis tools to Azure-specific utilities. But giving an agent too many tools doesn’t always make it smarter. Sometimes it just makes it slower.

If you’ve ever seen this spinner in VS Code, you’ve hit the limits of a model that’s trying to reason across too many tools at once.

![Image 14: Screenshot of a spinner next to the words "Optimizing tool selection..."](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tool-selection.png?resize=385%2C60)
To fix that,we’ve built two new systems—embedding-guided tool routing and adaptive tool clustering—and we’re rolling out a reduced toolset that trims the default 40 built-in tools down to 13 core ones. Across benchmarks like SWE-Lancer and SWEbench-Verified with both GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, these changes improve success rates by 2-5 percentage points. In online A/B testing,it reduces response latency by an average of 400 milliseconds.

Too many tools impede agent intelligence
----------------------------------------

The default toolset in VS Code consists of about 40 built-in tools,ranging from general command-line utilities to specialized tools for Jupyter Notebooks. With MCP servers included, that number can grow into the hundreds. Often, MCP servers bring in so many tools that they can exceed the API limits of some models.

We’ve explored ways to filter down our toolset to provide only the tools most relevant to the user’s query, while not restricting the agent’s capabilities.Specifically, we needed to make sure we didn’t sacrifice the user’s experience to achieve lower latency.

To accomplish this, we designed a middle-ground approach: “virtual tools.” This includes functionally grouping similar tools under one “virtual tool” the chat agent can expand as needed. Think of these as directories that contain related tools. This gives the model a general sense of what’s available without flooding it with hundreds of tool names.It also reduces the cache miss rate we’d expect if the model searched for individual tools, since it’s likely that similar tools are used and activated together.

Applying lossless dynamic tool selection for MCP tools
------------------------------------------------------

### Adaptive tool clustering

Initially we fed all the available tools into an LLM and asked it to group and summarize them. But this had two big issues:

*   We couldn’t control the number of groups created, and it sometimes exceeded model limits
*   It was extremely slow and incurred a huge token cost. The model would also sometimes ‘forget’ to categorize certain tools, forcing retries

To tackle this issue, we applied[our internal Copilot embedding model optimized for semantic similarity tasks](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/copilot-new-embedding-model-vs-code/)to generate embeddings for each tool and group them using cosine similarity. This clustering method allowed precise, stable, and reproducible groups. As an example, here is one possible grouping of embeddings for the GitHub MCP server’s tools in the embedding space:

![Image 15: A clustering chart showing groupings of embeddings for the GitHub MCP server's tools: create_pending_pull_request_review, get_issue_comments, create_branch, get_me, and list_tags.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tool-use.png?resize=1024%2C512)
We still use a model call to summarize each cluster, but this step is much faster and cheaper than asking the model to categorize everything from scratch. Tool embeddings and group summaries are cached locally, so recomputing them is comparatively cheap.

Context-guided tool selection
-----------------------------

Once tools were grouped, we faced another problem: how does the model know which group to open without checking them all?We saw that,most of the time, the model would _eventually_ find the right tool for its task. However, each call to a virtual tool still results in a cache miss, an extra round trip, and an opportunity for a small percentage of agent operations to fail.

For example, when the user says:_“Fix this bug and merge it into the dev branch.”_

The model often opens**search tools**, then**documentation tools**, then**local Git tools**, before finally realizing that it actually needs the**merge tool inside the GitHub MCP tool group**to complete the operation.

Each incorrect group lookup adds latency and overhead, even though the correct group is fairly obvious from the context.

To address this, we introduced**Embedding-Guided Tool Routing**. Before any tool group is expanded, the system compares the query embedding against vector representations of all tools (and their clusters), allowing it to pre-select the most semantically relevant candidates—even if they’re buried deep inside a group.

With context-aware routing, we can infer from the beginning that the model is very likely to need the _merge tool_ inside the GitHub MCP tool group, and include it directly in its candidate set—eliminating unnecessary exploratory calls and significantly reducing latency and failure rates.

By surfacing only the most promising matches, we make the model’s search more targeted and reliable, while reducing redundant exploration.

Embedding-based selection (powered by the Copilot Embedding model)
------------------------------------------------------------------

We calculate the success of our embedding-based selection process via**Tool Use Coverage,**which measures how often the model already has the right tool visible when it needs it.

In benchmarks, the embedding-based approach achieved 94.5% Tool Use Coverage,outperforming both LLM-based selection(87.5%) and the default static tool list (69.0%).

**Offline**, this approach resulted in a 27.5% absolute improvement in coverage, clearly surpassing the LLM-based method while helping the agent reason faster and stay efficient.

**Online testing**shows the same pattern: only**19%**of Stable tool calls were successfully pre-expanded using the old method,whereas**72%**of Insiders tool calls were pre-expanded thanks to the embedding-based matching. This confirms that the gains observed offline are consistently reflected in real-world usage.

![Image 16: A bar graph showing coverage rates. Embedding based is highest with 94.5%, followed by GPT-4.1 based at 87.5% and Default tools at 69%.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HumanEvalInfilling_1200x630.png?resize=1024%2C538)
Less is more: shrinking the default toolset
-------------------------------------------

Even without hitting the model limits that massive MCP servers can trigger, an oversized built-in toolset still degrades performance.In offline benchmarks, we observed a 2–5 percentage point decrease in resolution rate on benchmarks including SWE-Lancer when the agent had access to the full built-in toolset.Behaviorally, the agent ends up ignoring explicit instructions, using tools incorrectly, and calling tools that are unnecessary to the task at hand.

So, we trimmed the list. Based on tool usage statistics and performance data, we identified a core toolset of 13 essential tools. These tools encompass high-level repository structure parsing,file reading and editing, context searching,and terminal usage.

The remaining, non-core built-in tools are grouped into four virtual categories:Jupyter Notebook Tools, Web Interaction Tools, VS Code Workspace Tools, and Testing Tools. This way, the model sees the smaller core set up-front and can expand groups only if necessary.As a result,users with the shrunken toolset experience an average decrease of 190 milliseconds in TTFT (Time To First Token),and an average decrease of 400 milliseconds in TTFT (Time to Final Token, or time to complete model response).

A smaller toolset enables the agent to be more effective:simpler reasoning, faster response times, and better performance.

Future directions: from tool selection to long-context reasoning
----------------------------------------------------------------

As MCP systems evolve, the challenge isn’t just picking the right tool—it’s reasoning across time, context, and interactions.

A truly intelligent model shouldn’t just react to queries; it should _remember previous tool usage, infer intent from history, and plan multi-step actions_ over long sessions.In this sense, tool selection is an early form of long-context reasoning. The same mechanisms that help models route to the right tool today could, in the future, help them reason across thousands of turns helping them decide when to act, when to delegate, and when to stop.

Our next step is to explore how embeddings, memory, and reinforcement signals can combine to create context-aware agents that learn _how_ to use tools, not just _which_ ones to pick.
